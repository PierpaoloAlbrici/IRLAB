Chocolate Drizzled Almonds


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 2 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

Spread whole almonds in a single layer in shallow pan. Place in cold oven, roast at 350F for 12 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until fragrant. Place roasted almonds on foil, parchment paper or a serving platter. Melt chocolate in a small bowl in microwave for one minute at medium high power. Stir well. Microwave in additional 10-20 second intervals stirring until smooth. Pour melted chocolate into a baggie. Cut a small hole in a corner of the bag. Drizzle chocolate over the almonds in a decorative pattern. Place in the fridge to harden. ** Try drizzling your almonds with bittersweet, milk or white chocolate -- or a combination of all three!

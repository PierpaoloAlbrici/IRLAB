### Instructions

Preheat oven to 450F Mix flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, and cream of tartar in a medium bowl. Work the shortening into the flour mixture by crumbling with your hands until the mixture feels like cornmeal. Pour milk into flour mixture and mix well. On a slightly floured surface, knead the dough about 12-15 times. Make dough into balls (about 2 inches) and place on baking sheet. Brush Dough balls with some of the melted butter. Bake 10-12 minutes or until golden. Meanwhile Bring the remainder of the butter, and all of the honey to a boil in a sauce pan, then set the honey butter aside. When biscuits are done remove from the oven and immediately brush each biscuit with honey butter.

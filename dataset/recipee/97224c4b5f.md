### Ingredients

 - 2 1/3 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 5 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 13 cup of oil, canola

 - 13 cup of honey

 - 4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

Mix all together. I use a bread machine on dough cycle or a kitchenaid mixer. Let the machine mix it and add additional flour until the dough feels like patting a baby's back. Rise in the bread machine or oil, cover and rise inside a slightly warm oven. Shape into two loaves. Place in greased pan. Bake 35-40 minutes at 350 or until the bread sounds hollow when tapped top and bottom. Place on cooling rack. Slice when cooled.

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 12 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Stir all ingredients gently until mixed. Using electric beaters, beat dough on high for 10 minutes- NO LESS- this is very important! Drop by teaspoon full on ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 10 minutes, just until edges are light brown. Decorate if you like, I prefer not. Slivers of red or green candied cherries pressed on before baking make a nice holiday garnish.

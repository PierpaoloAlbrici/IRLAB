Ancient New England Standing Pumpkin Dish


Ingredients


 - 8 cup of pumpkin, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of vinegar, distilled


 - 14 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 13 cup of sugars, brown


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


Instructions: 

Put 2 cups of peeled diced pumpkin and 1/4 cup of water into a pot and cook gently over a low heat until they sink down. Keep adding more pumpkin until you have used all 8 cups. When cooked, the pumpkin will be tender and have kept much of its form, resembling stewed apples. Do not add more water. Remove from the heat and add butter, vinegar, brown sugar and spices. Stir gently and serve. Allow plenty of time to cook this dish. It must be done very slowly.

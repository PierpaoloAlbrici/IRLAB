### Ingredients

 - 14 cup of butter, without salt

 - 3 tablespoon of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 4 ounce of candies, semisweet chocolate

 - 2 tablespoon of orange juice, raw

 - 1 teaspoon of orange juice, raw

 - 4 ounce of candies, semisweet chocolate

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

In a medium saucepan, bring butter and cream to a boil over medium high heat. Remove from heat. Add chocolate, orange liqueur, and orange peel; stir until melted and smooth. Pour truffle mixture into a shallow bowl, or a 9X5 in loaf pan. Chill until firm, about 2 hours. Line 2 baking sheets with waxed paper. Shape chilled truffle mixture by rounded teaspoons into small balls. Place on prepared baking sheets. Chill until firm, about 30 minutes. In the top of a double boiler set over simmering (not boiling) water, heat chocolate and oil, stirring until melted and smooth. Transfer chocolate mixture to a bowl. Cool. Drop truffles into melted chocolate mixture. Using 2 forks, lift out truffles tapping gently on side of bowl to allow excess coating to drip back in bowl. Return truffles to baking sheets lined with waxed paper, and chill until set.

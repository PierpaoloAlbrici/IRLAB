Antipasto Pesto Dip


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of butter, without salt


 - 1 pound of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 34 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 10 ounce of spinach, raw


 - 14 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 3 tablespoon of sauce, pesto, classico, basil pesto, ready-to-serve


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


Instructions: 

With an electric mixer combine the cream cheese and butter and whip till light and fluffy. In a separate bowl combine the squeezed spinach, cheese, EVOO, garlic and pesto. Saran Wrap a mold or tall glass dish and layer the butter mixture and the pesto mixture to create a pretty layerd dip, beginning and ending with the butter mixture. Cover and refrigerate until set. I make this part the day before I am serving the dip. To serve, unmold and place in the center of your serving dish -- I use a punch bowl platter for this. Surround the dip with assorted veggies, baguette bread slices, prosciutto, pepperoni, salami, cheese cubes, olives, let your imagination be your guide.

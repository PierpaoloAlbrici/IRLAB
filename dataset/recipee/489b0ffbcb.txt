Dads Famous Meat Marinade


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 3/4 cup of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 1/4 cup of sauce, worcestershire


 - 2 tablespoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 2 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1/2 cup of vinegar, red wine


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, parsley, dried


 - 13 cup of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

Comine all the ingredients into a vessel and give it a good shake to combine. Ive found that either using a martini shaker or one glass over another is the best method or even putting it into a Ziploc bag and shaking it works. Just so its mixed! Toss the meat in with the marinade and let it do its job! 30 minutes if you want a hit of flavor, longer for a bit more kick. I usually marinate mine overnight for the best flavor. If cooking with filet, make sure to wrap in bacon to seal in the flavor.

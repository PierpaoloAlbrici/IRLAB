### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

 - 1/4 cup of salt, table

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

 - 1/2 cup of oil, corn, peanut, and olive

### Instructions

Place rice in a large bowl or pot, and add enough cold water to cover by at least 3 inches. Soak the rice for at least 4 hours or up to overnight. Combine the salt and sugar in a mixing bowl and set aside. Drain the rice and steam in a rice steamer for 45 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes. Alternatively, line a large steaming insert (that fits into a large pot) with cheesecloth and add the drained rice. Fill the bottom of the pot with at least 1 inch of water and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Place the steaming insert inside the pot, cover with cheesecloth, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 45 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes. Sprinkle each serving with some of the sugar mixture, coconut, and peanuts.

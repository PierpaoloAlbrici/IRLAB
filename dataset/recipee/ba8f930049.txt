Rocky Road, Chocolate Overload!


Ingredients


 - 3/4 pound of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 13 pound of butter, without salt


 - 3 tablespoon of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 7 ounce of martha white foods, martha white's buttermilk biscuit mix, dry


 - 3 1/2 ounce of candies, marshmallows


Instructions: 

Make sure you have a foil tart platelet handyround or square, whatever you prefer. (I use round.) Prepare a bain-marie (a pot of steaming water with a bowl over the top to use to melt chocolate). Keep it on medium heat, as you dont want the chocolate to melt too fast and burn. Place chopped dark chocolate, unsalted butter and golden syrup into the bowl on top of the bain-marie. Break the biscuits into a large mixing bowl, add mini marshmallows and mix roughly by hand. Keep an eye on the melting chocolate and stir until you have a rich, glossy melted chocolate (heavenly) concoction. Remove from heat. Taking care to ensure that at least one third of your melted chocolate mixture remains in the bowl (i.e. keep it! ), pour chocolate over your broken biscuit/marshmallow dry mix. Stir to coat all biscuit pieces and marshmallows, then press into foil tart platelet. Press down firmly and try to compact pieces as much as possible. Pour the remaining one third of melted chocolate over the top, to form a smooth chocolate topping. Refrigerate for approximately 10 minutes (or until ready to serve). Makes at least 10 slices (if youre using the round platelets), depending on how big a piece you cut!

### Ingredients

 - 2 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 tablespoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 3 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 5 1/2-6 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

Add the yeast to the water in a medium-large bowl, then sprinkle the sugar over the top of it. Let it sit for five minutes or so, or until the yeast mixture looks frothy on top. Stir in the salt, oil, and flour. Put a bowl of water in the microwave and heat it for a couple of minutes. Knead the dough until it's smooth, and comes away from the sides of the bowl easily. Add a bit more flour if it's sticky. Remove the water from the microwave and put in the dough. Let the dough rise in the microwave, door closed, for 15-30 minutes, until dough is almost doubled in size. (it was only about 1 1/2 times bigger for me, and was awesome! ). Now remove the dough and divide into two equal balls. Roll into rectangles, and then roll up, jelly roll style. Place both loaves next to each other ion lightly greased cookie sheet. Cover and let rise while you heat your oven to 375 degrees. Bake both loaves for 30-35 minutes, until golden brown. EAT!

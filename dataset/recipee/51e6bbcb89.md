### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of salt, table

 - 1/2 cup of spices, basil, dried

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 225 degrees F. Pulse the kosher salt and the basil together in a chopper or food processor (I only have a mini chopper and it worked just fine). Spread on a baking sheet and bake until dry, 30-40 minutes. Once it cools down, pulse again to make a fine powder. Voila! Basil salt! Recipe adapted from Food Network Magazine.

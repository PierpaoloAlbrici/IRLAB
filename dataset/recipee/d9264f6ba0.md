### Instructions

I've been playing around with these ingredients and my husband thinks I should "go public" with this recipe! It's for a bread machine, but you could make it by hand in the conventional way, too. In my Zojirushi machine the crust is rather dark (but still delicious) so other machines may need a light crust setting. Enjoy! Place ingred. in B/M in order given (start at bottom for)))) Welbilt/Dak) set crust to light and bake on white bread setting. I'm munching on the "heel" as I type and am thinking about how good a sandwich will be in a few hrs! Maybe next time I'll add in pepperoni and have all the sandwich ingredients in each slice. It has a real pizza taste! LINDA IN BIRMINGHAM 08/15 10:15 am

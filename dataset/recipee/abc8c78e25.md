[abc8c78e25](http://www.food.com/recipe/mock-rice-pudding-139479)

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

 - 6 ounce of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat

 - 1 teaspoon of sweetener, syrup, agave

 - 1 dash of spices, cinnamon, ground

### Instructions

Cook rice according to directions. Remove from heat. Add flavored yogurt, sweetner and spice (if using) to rice and stir. May be eaten warm or chilled. Any flavor of yogurt would be good in this recipe, but vanilla tastes most like real rice pudding. Chopped nuts and/or raisins would also be good sprinkled on top if you are not watching calories. Cooking time depends on type of rice used, regular takes longer than instant, I have based cooking time on instant.

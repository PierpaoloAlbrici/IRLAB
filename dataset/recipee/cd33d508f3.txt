Reese's Protein Shake


Ingredients


 - 8-12 ounce of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 2 scoop of beverages, protein powder whey based


 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 tablespoon of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


Instructions: 

Combine in a blender water, protein powder, pudding, splenda and peanut butter. Process until smooth. Drop in 6-8 ice cubes and process until smooth again. It gets kinda thick. You can sip on this all day! I put it in one of those cups that have the liquid in it that freezes to keep drinks cold. It started to freeze to the sides and was just like a decadent chocolate ice cream!

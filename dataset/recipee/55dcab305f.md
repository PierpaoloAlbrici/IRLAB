### Ingredients

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cumin seed

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, coriander seed

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, fennel seed

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

In heavy, dry skillet over medium-high heat, toast cumin, coriander and fennel seeds until fragrant, about 3 minutes. (Be careful not to burn spices.) Immediately transfer seeds to spice grinder (an inexpensive coffee grinder will do) or mortar and pestle and grind with cinnamon, ginger and red pepper flakes. Return spices to skillet. Add oil and heat just until oil is warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Strain oil through a fine-meshed strainer lined with cheesecloth and store in tightly closed jar.

Lou Malnati's Chicago Stylepizza Crust - Dough


Ingredients


 - 16 ounce of water, bottled, generic


 - 18 ounce of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 12 ounce of salt, table


 - 2 pound of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 14 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 14 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow


Instructions: 

In a mixer combine the water and the yeast and allow the yeast to dissolve. Add the remaining ingredients except for the cornmeal and begin to mix the dough using a dough hook on low speed. Once a ball is formed mix on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes until the dough becomes elastic and smooth. Remove from the mixer and place in a bowl coated with olive oil. Allow the dough to rest for approximately 4 hours. Once the dough is rested, place on flat surface and dust with some flour. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. In a deep baking dish or deep dish pizza pan, or cookie sheet for a thin crust pizza, oil the bottom and sides of the pan with your fingers, spread in the cornmeal and spread the dough using your fingers at the bottom of the pan and make sure to have enough dough to come up the sides of the pan approximately 1/2-inch high. Begin by placing a layer of the mozzarella cheese on the bottom of the crust. Cheese goes first on a Chicago Style pizza. Add the tomato sauce and all of the toppings. Place in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes until golden and crispy. If you want a regular pizza, use toppings of your cjhoice in the order of your choice. Serve pizza straight from the oven to the table. Good cold for breakfast too!

Cheddar and Chive Scones


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 23 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 1 cup of cheese, cheddar


 - 1 tablespoon of chives, raw


Instructions: 

Heat oven to 425 degrees. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in 2/3 c cream. Add cheddar and chives and use hands to combine; dough should be crumbly. Knead dough a couple of times until it comes together. Gently pat into a ball, then flatten slightly into a 1" thick disk. Transfer to a baking sheet. Slice into quarters, then cut each quarter in half. Brush top with remaining cream. Bake for about 30 minutes or until golden.

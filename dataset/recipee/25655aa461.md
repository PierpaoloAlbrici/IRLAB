### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of bacon, meatless

 - 2 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1/4 pinch of sugars, granulated

 - 2 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Cut the bacon strips in half, and place into a shallow dish with the half-and-half, crisscrossing the bacon in a star pattern. Soak the bacon a minimum of 30 minutes, but no more than 2 hours. This step helps reduce the curling of the bacon during frying, tenderizes it, and adds a wonderful flavor. Stir together the flour, salt, pepper, and sugar in another shallow dish until blended; set aside. When the bacon has finished soaking, remove it from the half-and-half, and shake off the excess. Press each piece into the flour mixture to coat, then set aside. If desired, you can place a sheet of wax paper between the rows of bacon once the plate is coved. However, the flour does a good job of keeping the bacon from sticking to each other. Heat the vegetable oil in a deep skillet over medium-low heat. Fry the bacon in batches until browned and cooked to desired degree of crispness, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on a paper towel.

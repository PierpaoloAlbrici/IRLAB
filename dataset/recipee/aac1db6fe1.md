### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of onions, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 pound of crustaceans, shrimp, raw (not previously frozen)

 - 3 cup of denny's, hash browns

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 12 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

 - 4 ounce of cheese, cheddar

 - 14 cup of parsley, fresh

### Instructions

Saute onions in butter in a large skillet until tender, about 5 minutes or so. Add water and bring to a boil. Add shrimp and cook 3-5 minutes, or until no longer translucent in center(be careful not to overcook them). Remove shrimp and place in a covered bowl. Add potatoes to the same pan, and season with salt & pepper to taste. Simmer for about 4-6 minutes, stirring as needed, until potatoes are tender. Add milk and half and half and bring to just a boil, stirring occasionally. Once it just comes to the boil, remove from heat and stir in the cheese until melted. Add shrimp back to the pot along with parsley, reserving a small portion of the parsley for garnishing if desired.

Chocolate Crunch


Ingredients


 - 6 ounce of candies, semisweet chocolate


 - 6 ounce of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

Instructions: 

Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil. In a double boiler, melt the semisweet and milk chocolates with the butter and oil over hot (not simmering) water, stirring constantly until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Remove the top part of the double boiler and let the chocolate cool to tepid (the chocolate may thicken slightly as it cools). Stir the nuts, cereal and white chocolate pieces into the cooled melted chocolate and pour the mixture out onto the prepared cookie sheet. Spread to the desired thickness. Refrigerate 20-30 minutes, or until set. Slide a metal spatula under the chocolate to loosen from the foil. Break into uneven pieces. Prep time includes refrigeration time.

Virginia Apple Pudding


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of apples, raw, with skin

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Melt butter in a 2 quart casserole dish. Combine sugar, flour, salt, baking powder, cinnamon and milk to make a batter. Pour the batter on the butter (without mixing).

Cow Camp Pan Bread (R Hanging Lazy A) Robert H. Arps


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 6 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow


 - 1 1/2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, chili powder


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 tablespoon of bacon, meatless


Instructions: 

You mix all of the dry ingredients together. Divide equally between two large ziplock bags. Now you have two batches.Take 1 tbsp mix and spread across a board. Pour lukewarm water in the zip lock bag, a little at a time. Close bag and knead, add a little more water, knead, add the rest of the water and knead. Turn out on board and pat or roll until about 1/4 inch high to 1/2 inch high.Pat some mix on top of dough if it gets too sticky or plain flour. Heat 2 tblsp. shortening or bacon grease in large cast iron frying pan over the heat, a grate over a campfire, a stove burner, or propane grill. You can plop the entire circle in the hot pan if you don't want to cut wedges before it is cooked. Make sure you don't burn it on the bottom. Remember this makes two batches. Cutting the wedges of dough first fries the wedges a little more and you have a more crispy texture on the sides and bottoms when flipped over. On the trail, you would sharpen a stick, cut the circle in 8 to 10 wedges. Off the trail, use a knife or dental floss. Lift off with a spatula, fry 4 to 5 wedges at a time and flip over until lightly brown. Note: Use 1/2 of each salt in the recipe if you want to use less salt or salt substitute.

Spicy Oven Roasted Potato Wedges


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 pound of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, paprika


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


Instructions: 

Preaheat the oven to 525F Scrub and quarter the potatoes (you can peel them if you like - I never do and I think the skins make them crispier) and place them in a large bowl. Drizzle the olive oil over the potatoes and toss to coat. Sprinkle seasonings over potatoes and toss to coal well. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray the foil with cooking spray. Arrange the potatoes in one layer on the baking sheet. Roast for 20 minutes, turning once halfway through cooking.

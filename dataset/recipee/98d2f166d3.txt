Homemade Peanut Butter


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of oil, corn, peanut, and olive


 - 1 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

Put the peanuts in your food processor and blend until it forms a ball. Scrape the sides and turn the food processor back on and drizzle in the oil. Keep blending for another minute until the peanut butter is the consistency you like. You can add salt, sugar or honey to taste. If you like crunchy peanut butter, add in 1/2 cup chopped peanuts at the end. Enjoy!

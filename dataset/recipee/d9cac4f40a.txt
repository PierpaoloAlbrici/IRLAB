Caramelized Brussels Sprouts


Ingredients


 - 3 pound of brussels sprouts, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1/4 cup of capers, canned


 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 2 tablespoon of cheese, parmesan, hard


Instructions: 

Stem the Brussels sprouts and peel off any wilted or bruised outer leaves. With a paring knife, cut a shallow X into the stem end to help the sprouts become a bit more tender during cooking. Cut each sprout in half. In a saucepan, bring 2 quarts of water to a boil, then add 1 tablespoon of the salt and the Brussels sprouts. Cook until tender when pierced with a knife, about 10 minutes. In a large saute pan, melt the butter over medium-high heat and cook until golden brown. Add the sprouts. Cook for about 10 minutes, constantly moving the sprouts from side to side until theyre well caramelized on all sides. Remove from the heat and add the capers, lemon juice, pepper, and the 1 teaspoon salt. Sprinkle with the cheese and serve.

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of alcoholic beverage, beer, regular, all

 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1/2 cup of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/4 cup of seeds, sesame butter, tahini, from roasted and toasted kernels (most common type)

 - 1/4 cup of cornstarch

 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, onion powder

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/2 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 1 pinch of spices, pepper, black

 - 1 pinch of spices, nutmeg, ground

### Instructions

Place all the ingredients into a blender and process until the mixture is completely smooth. Pour into a medium saucepan and heat over a medium heat, stirring constantly until thick and smooth. Alternatively, heat in the microwave, stirring every 10 seconds until thick and smooth (should only take a couple of minutes depending on your microwave). Transfer to a fondue pot and keep warm over a very low flam. Add more liquid to thin out the liquid if it gets too thick.

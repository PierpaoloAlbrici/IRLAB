Caramel Frosting for Angel Food Cake


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of sugars, brown


 - 14 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 3 1/4 cup of sugars, powdered


Instructions: 

Melt the butter in a saucepan and then add the brown sugar. Boil and stir for at least one minute. Take the saucepan off the heat and add the milk. With a hand mixer beat in the powdered sugar, one cup at a time until the spreading consistency is right for you. It should not be a very thick consistency for angel food cake, because it will harden as it cools.

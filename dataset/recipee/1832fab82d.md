### Ingredients

 - 500 g of beverages, ovaltine, classic malt powder

 - 150 g of salt, table

 - 500 ml of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Put the ingredients into a glass or enamel jar (the salt content is very high, so I don't recommend using a plastic bottle or Tupperware). Close the lid and let sit at room temperature. Give it a shake once a day. After 10 days, it will become a thick malt with a nice fragrance. Store it in the refrigerator. Shio-koji is alive. If you use natural salt, malt, and water, it can be stored for more than 3 months. [Shio-koji dressing] Mix together 2 tablespoons sesame oil (or olive oil), 1-2 teaspoons shio-koji, 1 teaspoon vinegar, and 1/2 grated onion.

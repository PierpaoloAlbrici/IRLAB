Pistachio Frosting


Ingredients


 - 115 g of butter, without salt


 - 40 g of sugars, powdered


 - 230 g of nuts, pistachio nuts, raw


 - 2 g of salt, table


Instructions: 

Combine the butter and confectioners sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and cream together on medium-high for 2 to 3 minutes, until fluffy and pale yellow. Add the pistachio paste and salt and mix on low speed for half a minute, then kick up the speed to medium-high and let her rip for 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. If the mixture is not all the same pale green color, give it another minute on high speed, and scrape down again. Use the frosting immediately, or store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week.

### Ingredients

 - 190 g of cookies, graham crackers, plain or honey, lowfat

 - 20 g of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 25 g of sugars, granulated

 - 3 g of salt, table

 - 55 g of butter, without salt

 - 55 g of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

### Instructions

Toss the graham crumbs, milk powder, sugar, and salt with your hands in a medium bowl to evenly distribute your dry ingredients. Whisk the butter and heavy cream together. Add to the dry ingredients and toss again to evenly distribute. The butter will act as a glue, adhering to the dry ingredients and turning the mixture into a bunch of small clusters. The mixture should hold its shape if squeezed tightly in the palm of your hand. If it is not moist enough to do so, melt an additional 14 to 25 g (1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons) butter and mix it in. Eat immediately, or deploy as directed in a recipe. The crust is easiest to mold just after mixing. Stored in an airtight container, graham crust will keep fresh for 1 week at room temperature or for 1 month in the fridge or freezer.

best to use a kitchenaid mixer for this using the hook attachment. mix all the ingredients together until you get the right consistency. you can see if you got the right consistency if you turn the mixer on max and it whips the dough apart making 2 or more balls. add more flour or water until you get that consistency put some oil in a bowl and wipe it off with a paper towel. make the dough into a ball and put it in the bowl. cover for minimal 3 hours. freeze in a freezer bag or spread it out on a floured countertop.

Ingredients


 - 1 cup of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 1 cup of spices, basil, dried


 - 1 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular


 - 1 1/2 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


 - 2 tablespoon of onions, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


Instructions: 

Put the sweet peppers and bail into a food processor or mini chopper and blitz for about 30 seconds until the sweet peppers are really finely chopped and combined with the basil. Combine the mayo, yogurt, onion flakes and garlic powder in a bowl making sure everything is well mixed. Stir in the sweet red pepper mixture and combine well. Cover and chill in the fridge for at least and hour but the longer the better so the flavors develop. Take out and serve or spread on a sandwich like normal mayo.

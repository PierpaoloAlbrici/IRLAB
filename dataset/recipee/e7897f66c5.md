[e7897f66c5](http://www.food.com/recipe/moms-cecile-maple-walnut-fudge-479874)

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of sugars, brown

 - 2 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

 - 1 cup of nuts, walnuts, english

 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 14 teaspoon of vanilla extract

### Instructions

Using a heavy deep saucepan, cook brown sugar and cream on low boil, stirring often until the soft ball stage is reached, or the mixture forms a long thread when dropped from a spoon. This will take about 10-15 minutes. Take off the stove and by hand, beat in the butter and vanilla. The mixture should thicken, then you can add the nuts if desired. Let the mixture cool about 10 minutes; then pour into a buttered glass dish (8x8 cake pan) let cool in the fridge, then cut into pieces.

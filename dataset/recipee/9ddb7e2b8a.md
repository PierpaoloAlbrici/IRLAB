### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/4 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Mix together flour and salt. Cut in shortening into the flour. Add warm water and knead until the dough is springy. Place on a piece of parchment paper, over with clean cloth and let rest for 10 min. In a lightly flour board, use a rolling pin to roll the dough balls into thin circles, 7-8 inches across. Bake on a hot, ungreased griddle until speckled with brown. Flip and cook the other side. To store them, place in a plastic bag in the fridge.

### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 23 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 3 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 13 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

### Instructions

Melt butter. Stir in cocoa. Alternately add powdered sugar and milk, beating to spreading consistency. Add a small amount of additional milk, if needed. Stir in vanilla.

Vanilla Frosting


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of shortening, vegetable, household, composite


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 3 cup of sugars, powdered


 - 1/4 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the shortening and salt on medium speed for about 1 minute. Add the confectioners sugar, rice milk, and vanilla. Beat until smooth and fluffy, about 5 minutes. You can either pipe the frosting or spread it with a butter knife or frosting spatula, creating pretty swirls. If youre into making cupcakes, invest in a mechanical pastry bag. Williams-Sonoma makes a great one, and it will make piping frosting an easy dream. No more fussing with messy pastry bagsjust fill and press. I truly love mine, and I dont use the word love lightly.

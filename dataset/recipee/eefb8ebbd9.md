### Ingredients

 - 2 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1/4 cup of honey

 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 cup of oats

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 5 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

(I am so lucky to have a Bosch mixer to make my bread in! If you dont have one, adjust accordingly.) Combine water, yeast and honey in mixer bowl and mix until just combined. Put the lid on and let it sit for 10 minutes or so, until it gets frothy. Then add the rest of the ingredients into the bowl and mix until it just comes together and then check the dough for consistency if its very sticky, add a little flour, if its dry add a little lukewarm water. The dough should feel just slightly sticky. Once the dough is the right consistency, mix on medium speed for about 8 minutes, then turn the dough out into a large oiled bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place for about an hour. I put my bowl next to the coffee maker to keep warm. After the dough has risen, punch it down and form into loaves or rolls or both, like I do. I roll mine out for loaves and put into a greased 9x5 loaf pan, and for rolls I follow PWs lead and put rolls, evenly spaced, into a buttered 12 cast-iron skillet. Let rise again, about 30 45 minutes, depending on how warm it is where theyre rising. Bake the loaves at 350F for 30-40 minutes (put a foil tent on for the last 10 minutes or so to prevent over-browning). Bake the rolls at 400F for 15-20 minutes. Turn the bread or rolls out of the pans onto a cooling rack right away after theyre done so the bottom crust doesnt get soggy.

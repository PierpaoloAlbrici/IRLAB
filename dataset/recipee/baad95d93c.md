[baad95d93c](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/breakfastbrunch/strawberry-crepe-filling/)

### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of strawberries, raw

 - 13 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 cup of cheese, cottage, creamed, large or small curd

 - 1 cup of cream, sour, cultured

 - 1/2 cup of sugars, powdered

### Instructions

Mix strawberries and sugar. Set aside. Cream cottage cheese and sour cream in the blender or food processor until smooth. Add the powdered sugar. Blend well. Fill crepes with some of the creamy filling and top with strawberries. I like to put the filling in a Ziploc bag, cut off the corner and pipe the filling right onto the crepes. It looks prettier, too! Roll up, dust with powdered sugar if desired or if it lasts that long!

Vegan Fudge


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 1/2 cup of honey


 - 1/4 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Scoop roasted almond butter into bowl. Pour in honey (or guava syrup) and stir until combined. Add in the cocoa powder and stir until well blended. Stir in vanilla and salt. Spread into cake pan or pie plate so that the mixture is less than an inch thick. Place in freezer for 24 hours until hard. Serve in small pieces and re-freeze, as this will soften if left out.

### Ingredients

 - 180 g of sweet potato, raw, unprepared

 - 30 g of sugars, granulated

 - 100 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched

 - 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 50 ml of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 tablespoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

### Instructions

Put the sweet potato in a silicon steamer and microwave until tender. While still hot, scoop out the flesh, add sugar, and pass through a sieve to strain. Combine cake flour and baking powder in a bowl, and whisk until smooth and fluffy. Add strained sweet potato and vegetable oil to the dry ingredients and mix. Once the batter forms a dough, wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. Roll out the dough to 5 mm thickness, then cut with a cookie cutter. Sprinkle black sesame seeds and bake for 15 minutes in an oven set to 360F/180C.

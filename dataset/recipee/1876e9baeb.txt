Momma's Shortbread


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350F. Mix all the ingredients together, until it looks like wet sand. Form into a ball, and put on an ungreased cookie sheet. Pat it down so it forms a thick pie-shaped form. Cut into several traingles (on the top it should look about the width of the 4 tongs on a fork). With a fork, imprint the 4 tongs on the top. Bake until it looks brown, about 10-20 minutes.

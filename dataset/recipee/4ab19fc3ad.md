### Ingredients

 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 3/4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1/4 cup of onions, raw

 - 1 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw

 - 1 pound of broccoli, raw

 - 1 cup of cheese, cheddar

 - 10 ounce of soup, cream of chicken, canned, condensed

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Crust: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Spray pie plate with nonstick spray. Whisk together dry ingredients (flour, 1 teaspoon salt, baking powder). Blend in cold butter cubes until it forms a meal consistency. Blend in 3/4 cup of whole milk (you may need slightly more, depending on the texture). This should form a biscuit-like dough. Gather the dough into a ball and divide in half. Roll out the first half of dough to fit your pie plate (usually about 12 round). I roll the dough right on a well-floured counter, but you can use waxed paper or plastic wrap, if you prefer. Its a pretty sticky dough, so youll probably need extra flour with any method. Place the rolled-out crust in your pie plate and trim off any excess. You can roll out the second crust now or put the dough in the fridge and roll it right before you place it on top of the filling. I usually par-bake the bottom crust for about 8 to 10 minutes to avoid sogginess. Filling: Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions and saute until edges are clear and soft. Add cubed chicken and brown. Add broccoli (if using frozen, you may want to nuke it for a few minutes first) and stir. Add shredded cheese, cream of mushroom soup, milk and stir together. Heat for a few minutes to thicken. Pour the warm filling into the bottom crust. Place the top crust over the filling and pinch the edges to close. Brush the top crust with 2 tablespoons melted butter and sprinkle a few pinches of kosher salt. Be sure to cut steam vents in the top crust after. Bake for about 25 minutes or until crust is golden on edges and filling is bubbling slightly.

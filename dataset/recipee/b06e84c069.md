### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 3/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 teaspoon of sugars, granulated

 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 12 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat

 - 3 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 23 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 14 cup of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

### Instructions

Make the dough with a bread machine. (Or by hand and let rise for 2 hours. ). Move the dough out onto a floured surface. Make into a ring with floured hands. (You can do this by lengthening the dough and connect the ends. What I did was flatten the ball of dough a bit and put ample flour on the center and dug a hole through it. You'd need ample flour on the center bottom of the dough too. Then put both hands through the hole, hold it up and gently enlarge the ring into doughnut shape with help from gravity. The photo shows only one hand because one hand was taking the picture. ). Let the ring of dough rise a second time in a warm place for 20-30 minute or untill doubled in size. Cut slashes of your own design, then bake at 375F for 35 minutes. (You have to watch during the last few minutes because it can get too dark very fast. ).

[c9c6c7f2f8](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/salads/easy-carrot-raisin-salad/)

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of carrots, raw

 - 38 cup of raisins, seeded

 - 13 cup of pineapple, raw, all varieties

 - 1 tablespoon of cream, sour, cultured

 - 1 tablespoon of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat

 - 18 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground

 - 18 teaspoon of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

Mix all the ingredients in a bowl, and refrigerate. It doesnt get any easier than that! Some things to keep in mind: It takes about 2 medium carrots to get 1 cup shredded. 3/8 cup raisins is 1/4 plus 2 tablespoons. The longer you refrigerate the salad, the better it is. Id go with a two-hour minimum, but making it the night before is preferred.

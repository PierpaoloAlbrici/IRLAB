### Ingredients

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 2 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 12 cup of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry

 - 14 cup of celery, raw

### Instructions

In a heavy saucepan, melt the butter. Sprinkle the flour over it and stir to incorporate. Cook over medium low heat for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly. Slowly whisk in the milk. Cream of chicken. If you want to make a cream of chicken flavored sauce, use half broth and half milk. If you have troubles getting this to be smooth, try heating the milk or broth before adding to the flour and butter. Bring to a simmer and cook over low heat, barely simmering, for a few minutes until thick. Cream of celery or mushroom. To make a cream of something, saute 1/4 cup or so finely chopped celery, mushrooms, or onion in the butter before adding the flour and use half broth and half milk.

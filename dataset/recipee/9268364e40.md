### Instructions

Add the essential oils to the salt using an eye dropper in a clean bowl. Mix with a spoon for half a minute. Make a sachet by tying this in fabric. To do this, cut fabric swatches into either circles or squares, about 5" by 5", to make balls by placing 1/2 cup of this formula in the middle and gathering up the sides. Then, tie this with a ribbon or bow to make a ball-shaped sachet. Enjoy!

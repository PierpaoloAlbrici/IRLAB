Pour all at once over the flour mixture. Mix with a fork until the flour mixture is completely moistened. Pat the dough with your fingers, first up the side of the plate then across the bottom. Flute the edges. Shell is now ready to be filled. If you are preparing a shell to be filled later, or your recipe requires a pre-baked crust, pre-heat the oven to 425F prick the surface of the pastry with a fork and bake 15 minutes, checking often, and pricking more if needed. For a 10 min shell, use 2c flour, 2t sugar, 1 t salt 2/3 cup oil and 3T milk.

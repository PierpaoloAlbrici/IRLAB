### Ingredients

 - 1/2 pint of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 12 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

### Instructions

Using a double boiler, heat the cream and butter over medium heat until it boils. While you are waiting for it to boil place the chocolate chips in a heat proof bowl. When the cream has started to boil remove it from the heat and pour it over the chocolate. Let mixture stand for 5 or 6 minutes to allow the chocolate to melt. Then stir briskly until you have a smooth and slightly shiny ganache with no streaks or lumps. Extra ganache can be kept in an airtight container for up to a month in the fridge. To reheat it, place the container in the microwave for 10 seconds at a time, stirring in between each interval until fully melted.

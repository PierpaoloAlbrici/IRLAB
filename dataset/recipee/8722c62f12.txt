Pepper Jelly Tarts


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of cheese, cheddar


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, paprika


 - 18 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 23 cup of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


Instructions: 

Combine the cheese, butter, paprika, cayenne in a mixing bowl and beat until smooth. Add the flour, combining with a fork until it forms a nice ball of dough. Roll into small balls and place each into tart tin. You should get at least 30 tarts. Press each ball with fingers to shape tart shell bottom and sides. Spoon 1 teaspoon jelly into each mini tart. Bake 400 degrees for 10 minutes OR until golden. Cool in pans five minutes, then remove from pans to a wire cooling rack. Serve warm or at room temperature. Variations:. You can also put in a tiny cube of cream cheese than the hot pepper jelly. Or tiny pieces of Brie cheese rinds removed than top with the pepper jelly, another element of tang. We also have placed a tiny cube of cream cheese and placed in some raspberry seedles jam on top. ( the crust gives the heat and then the jam gives a touch of sweetness. ).

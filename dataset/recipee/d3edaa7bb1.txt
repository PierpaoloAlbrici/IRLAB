Mock Nutella Spread


Ingredients


 - 34 cup of nuts, hazelnuts or filberts


 - 14 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 1/2-1 tablespoon of oil, canola


Instructions: 

Place the hazelnuts in a dry skillet and toast over medium heat 2-4 minutes or until just starting to brown. Place the hazelnuts and the chocolate chips in the work bowl of a mini food processor fitted with a metal blade. Process for 3-5 minutes until the mixture starts to become smooth. (the heat from the nuts and processing will melt the chocolate and help it become smooth). Drizzle in 1/2 tablespoon of oil while continuing to process. If necessary, add another 1/2 tablespoon of oil until the mixture becomes smooth and spreadable.

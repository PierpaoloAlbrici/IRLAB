### Ingredients

 - 300 g of crustaceans, shrimp, raw (not previously frozen)

 - 15 g of butter, without salt

 - 2 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 10 g of spices, garlic powder

 - 3 g of cheese, mozzarella, low sodium

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, oregano, dried

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, parsley, dried

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 pinch of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Trim the antennae of the shrimp. Pierce along the bodies of the shrimp with skewers. Use the tip of a sharp knife or scissors to cut a slit down the back of each shrimp, and remove the black line (vein). Rinse and pat dry the shrimp. Mix the other ingredients thoroughly to make the butter garlic mixture. Tuck the butter garlic mixture into the previously cut back of the shrimp with a small spoon. Brush the shrimp with the remaining mixture. Place the shrimp on the grill. Grill at 200-210C (400-410F) until cooked through. I put the shrimp in first, then heated the grill - after 25-30 minutes the shrimp was finely grilled. Serve hot with a little fresh lemon. Ah, it will be perfect with a glass of cold white wine.

Irish Soda Bread


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 2 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and grease a baking sheet or 8 inch round pan. Mix the flour, salt and baking soda; add the buttermilk and stir briskly with a fork until the dough holds together in a rough mass. Knead on a lightly floured board for about 30 seconds, then form into an 8 inch round, about 1 1/2 inched thick. Slash a large 1/4 inch deep X across the top and bake for 45-50 minutes, until browned and the X has spread open. Cool on a rack, then wrap in a slightly damp towel and let rest on the rack for at least 8 hours (although we often eat it as soon as it cools).

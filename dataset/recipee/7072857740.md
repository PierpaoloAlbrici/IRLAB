### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of spices, ginger, ground

 - 1/2 cup of sugars, brown

### Instructions

In a small saucepan, combine the ginger and 1 quart water. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Strain, then add the sugar and stir until it is completely dissolved. Taste and adjust the seasoning (you can add more water if it is too strong or, of course, more sugar). Serve hot or iced.

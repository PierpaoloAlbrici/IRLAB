Crispy Parmesan Bowls


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 8 cup of salad dressing, caesar dressing, regular


Instructions: 

In a large nonstick skillet, spread 1/4 cup cheese thinly and evenly over the bottom to form a 7-inch circle. Put the pan over medium heat and cook until the cheese is bubbling and lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Put a small bowl upside down on a cutting board. When the bubbling stops, about 1 minute, carefully remove the disk with a thin metal spatula and drape it over the bowl. Press gently with the spatula so it forms a bowl. Be careful, as it is very fragile. Let cool. Remove the Parmesan bowl, put it onto a plate, and fill with Caesar salad. Serve.

Baby Onions With Balsamic ... Recipe


Ingredients


 - 2 pound of onions, raw


 - 4 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 cup of vinegar, balsamic


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, rosemary, dried


Instructions: 

Peel the onions, leaving and washing any root strands you may find. In a 12- to 14-inch saute/fry pan over a medium high flame, heat the extra virgin olive oil till just smoking. Add in the butter and cook till the foam subsides. Add in the onions and saute/fry till light golden on all sides, about 8 to 10 min. Add in the sugar, vinegar, rosemary, and water and bring to a boil. Cook the onions uncovered, till just al dente, about 10 min. If the liquid dissipates too quickly, add in more water, 1/4 c. at a time, realizing which it is essential not to overcook the onions. The sauce should just adhere to the onions. Remove from the saute/fry pan to an earthenware dish and hold in a hot place, or possibly allow to cold if you are serving them later or possibly as an antipasto. This recipe yields 4 servings.

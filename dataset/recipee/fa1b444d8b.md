### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground

 - 18 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 cup of nuts, pecans

 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F Beat butter in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add the confectioners sugar, vanilla, nutmeg and salt; beat until well blended. Stir in flour and pecans. Shape into 1-inch balls. Place 1 inch apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake 15 minutes. Remove from baking sheets. Immediately roll hot cookies in the confectioners sugar. Place sugared cookies on wire racks to cool. When cool, roll again in sugar at least once but I like to do it twice for a better finish.

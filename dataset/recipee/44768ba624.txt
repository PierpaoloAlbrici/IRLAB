Bob's Red Mill Wheat Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 3 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 425F. Sift together flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Using your fingers, rub cubes of cold butter into the flour until it resembles coarse crumbs. Add buttermilk and stir until moistened, then knead a few times, just enough to make the dough come together. Drop about 1/4 cup dough onto parchment paper and flatten slightly, or you may choose to roll about half inch thick and cut them, placing them on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Bake for about 12 minutes, or until tops are golden brown and a toothpick comes out clean.

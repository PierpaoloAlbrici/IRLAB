Spinach Feta Turkey Burgers


Ingredients


 - 19 1/4 ounce of ground turkey, raw


 - 3 tablespoon of salad dressing, italian dressing, commercial, regular


 - 2 tablespoon of seeds, flaxseed


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, coriander seed


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 1 cup of spinach, raw


 - 13 cup of cheese, feta


Instructions: 

In a medium mixing bowl, combine turkey, dressing, flaxseed and spices. Mix until thoroughly combined. Stir in spinach and feta and mix well. Form into evenly-portioned patties. In the center of each patty, make a small dent with your thumb (this will help them retain their shape). Preheat a well greased large skillet pan on medium to medium low heat. Once hot, place patties on skillet and cook for 1012 minutes. If patties are browning too quickly, turn heat down a bit. Flip patties and cook another 35 minutes until no longer pink inside. Stovetop temperatures vary, which may increase or reduce cooking times. Serve in buns or over a bed of fresh spinach.

Southern Buttermilk Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 14 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 14 cup of shortening, vegetable, household, composite


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 34 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Heat oven to 450 and adjust oven rack to center position. In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, soda, and salt. Cut in chilled shortening and butter until you have pieces the size of small peas. Make a well in center of dry ingredients; pour in buttermilk. With a wooden spoon, gently blend dry ingredients into the buttermilk, just until mixture is clumping together. If necessary, add a few more teaspoons of buttermilk. Transfer dough to a lightly floured board. Pat out in a circle about 8 inches in diameter and 1/2-inch thick. Using a 2 1/2 to 3-inch biscuit cutter, cut out and place on ungreased baking sheet. Bake on center oven rack for about 10 to 12 minutes, until tops are browned.

[570fb1cfa7](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/mexican-bride-cookies/)

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

 - 1 cup of nuts, pecans

 - 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract

### Instructions

Preheat oven 350 degrees F (150 degrees C). Mix the flour, sugar, salt, and nuts together in a medium bowl. Stir in the vanilla. Either with your hands (my favorite way) or with a pastry cutter, work the butter into the flour mixture until it becomes a ball. Shape the dough into 24 one inch flat circles, and place on a cookie sheet. Bake for 30 minutes or until they are lightly browned. After they have cooled on a rack, dust them heavily with confectioners' sugar.

Perfect Parmesan Pizza Dough


Ingredients


 - 5 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

Mix 4 cups flour, Parmesan, yeast and salt in large bowl. Add water and oil; stir until mixture forms soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface 5 min. or until smooth and elastic, gradually adding remaining flour. Cut dough into 4 pieces. (Each piece is enough for a 12-inch pizza.) Spray each piece with cooking spray. If using immediately, cover desired number of dough pieces loosely with plastic wrap; let stand 15 min. Place each remaining dough piece in separate resealable freezer-weight plastic bag that has been sprayed with cooking spray. Seal bags; refrigerate up to 2 days or freeze up to 3 months.

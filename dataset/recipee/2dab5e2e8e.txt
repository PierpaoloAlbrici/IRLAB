Pumpkin Spice Cookies (Egg-Free)


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 18 teaspoon of spices, cloves, ground


 - 18 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground


 - 1/2 cup of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, brown


 - 13 cup of pumpkin, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


Instructions: 

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Stir and set aside. In a large bowl, cream together margarine, sugar, and the brown sugar. Add the pumpkin and vanilla extract and beat well. Add the flour mixture to the creamed mixture and beat until just combined. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper. In a small bowl, prepare the cinnamon sugar. Stir together the sugar and cinnamon. Pinch off tablespoon-sized amounts of dough and roll into balls between your palms. Roll the balls of dough in the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Place balls of dough on the prepared cookie sheets about two inches apart. Bake for 1012 minutes or until just beginning to brown on the bottom. Allow to cool for a minute on the sheet and then remove to a wire rack to cool completely. Makes about 3 dozen cookies.

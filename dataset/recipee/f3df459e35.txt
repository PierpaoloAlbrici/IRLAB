Glazed Parsnips


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of parsnips, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of sauce, teriyaki, ready-to-serve


Instructions: 

Place parsnips in a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and allow to cool slightly. Cut parsnips into 2 1/2-in sticks. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in sugar and parsnips; toss to coat. Add teriyaki sauce and continue to cook and stir until sauce is absorbed, about 5 minutes.

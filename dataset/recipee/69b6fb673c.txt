Mushroom Fry-Up


Ingredients


 - 12 pound of mushrooms, white, raw


 - 12 pound of mushrooms, white, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, coriander seed


 - 2 tablespoon of chives, raw


Instructions: 

Wipe mushrooms clean with a clean, damp cloth, then cut them in half. Heat a large frying pan over high heat for several minutes, then add the oil & get it really hot. Drop the butter into the hot oil, where it will quickly sizzle & start to turn golden. BEFORE it turns brown, add the mushrooms! QUICKLY cook the mushrooms for NO MORE THAN 4 1/2 to 5 minutes, stirring once or twice, until lightly browned. If the mushrooms are cooked too slowly, they will stew, give off liquid & become a soupy mess. Season with black pepper & salt, then add the coriander & chives. Immediately spoon the mushrooms into a serving bowl & ENJOY!

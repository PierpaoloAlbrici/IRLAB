### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of nuts, walnuts, english

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2/3 cup of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

 - 1 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large, wide saucepan, combine the walnuts, sugar and water and bring to a boil. Add the sesame seeds, cayenne and salt and cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until the water is nearly evaporated, about 4 minutes. Lower the heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the walnuts are golden brown and sandy, about 4 minutes longer. Immediately pour the walnuts onto the prepared baking sheet and spread in a single layer. Bake for about 20 minutes, until the nuts are deeply golden and covered with a sandy coating. Let the walnuts cool completely. Break any large clusters apart; transfer to a bowl to serve.

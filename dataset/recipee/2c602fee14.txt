Trash Bars


Ingredients


 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 10 ounce of candies, marshmallows


 - 1 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


 - 6 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt


 - 2 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, powdered


Instructions: 

1. Lightly butter or spray with nonstick spray a 9 x 13 baking dish, set aside. In a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, melt together the butter, marshmallows, 1/2 cup of peanut butter, and cocoa. Stir mixture frequently to prevent marshmallows from scorching. 2. When mixture is melted, quickly fold in the Rice Chex cereal and mix until cereal is evenly coated. Press evenly into the 9 x 13 pan, pushing down lightly on the cereal to pack it tightly, but not crushing it. You want those little air pockets intact! Set aside. 3. In a medium bowl, combine the remaining 1 cup of peanut butter and semi-sweet chocolate chips. Microwave at 15 second intervals, stirring in between to prevent chocolate from burning, until chocolate is completely melted. Spread evenly over the cereal mixture in the pan and allow to cool and chocolate topping to firm up. When firm, dust with powdered sugar, cut in squares and serve.

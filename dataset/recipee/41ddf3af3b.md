[41ddf3af3b](http://www.food.com/recipe/grandpa-slabaughs-bbq-sauce-195636)

### Ingredients

 - 1 pint of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 pint of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 pint of vinegar, distilled

 - 3 tablespoon of sauce, worcestershire

 - 5 tablespoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Mix all together and bring to a boil over the stove just to dissolve salt and mix flavors. Dip each piece of chicken in sauce and place on hot grill. (NOTE: do not store any sauce that has come into contact with the chicken. If not using all of the sauce at one cooking, separate what you want to store from what you will be cooking with. ). Baste intermittently as the chicken cooks. Direct flame will brown the chicken more than cooking NOT directly over the fire (indirect). Chicken will be juicier if you cook indirect however, so I normally will move the chicken on and off the direct flame, rotating them for even cooking. This helps to brown each piece but doesn't dry out the chicken. Using this method I normally cook the chicken 45 - 60 minutes.

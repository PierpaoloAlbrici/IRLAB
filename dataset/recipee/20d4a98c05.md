### Ingredients

 - 34 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 tablespoon of seeds, flaxseed

 - 3 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 tablespoon of vinegar, cider

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 1 teaspoon of honey

### Instructions

Pour oil into the immersion blender cup. Add all other ingredients. Place blender into the cup. With the blade resting flat on the bottom of the cup, blend the mixture for a few seconds until it no longer incorporates. Tilt the blender or lift it a bit to allow more oil to flow into the blade as you continue mixing. Blend until no more oil incorporates. Total blending time is about 15 seconds. Don't worry if a bit of oil on the top doesn't incorporate. Simply remove the blender, and use a spoon to stir it inches. Cover and store in the fridge.

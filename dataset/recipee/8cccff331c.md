### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of cabbage, raw

 - 14 cup of carrots, raw

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 12 teaspoon of celery, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of vinegar, cider

 - 2 tablespoon of pickle relish, sweet

 - 2 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 13 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular

### Instructions

Note: The 4 cups of cabbage is equal to one-half of a large head of cabbage. You may purchase a bag of precut cabbage at the grocery. I use a food processor to finely chop the cabbage. If you do not have one, you may chop with a knife. Using a large mixing bowl, mix all ingredients. The mayonnaise and milk may be increased for a more wet type of coleslaw. Chill in refrigerator for 2 hours to let flavors meld. This coleslaw will last 2 days chilled.

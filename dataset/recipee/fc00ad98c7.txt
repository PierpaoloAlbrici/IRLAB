Pumpkin Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 13 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 12 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 23 cup of pumpkin, raw


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 425F Grease a bake sheet. Sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon. Cut in the butter with a pastry blender until the mixture looks like coarse meal or crumbs. Stir in the pecans. Combine the cream and the pumpkin. Stir into the flour mixture just enough to moisten the dry ingredients. You will have a stiff dough. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured board and knead gently a few times. Roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut with a 2-inch biscuit cutter. Place 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes.

Cheddar Crackers


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 dash of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 2 cup of cheese, cheddar


Instructions: 

Stir the dry ingredients into a bowl and then cut in the butter to resemble cornmeal. Blend in the cheddar cheese with a fork until well blended. Mix in the remaining ingredients and shape into 1 1/2 to 2-inch rolls. Chill for 30 to 40 minutes in the refrigerator and then slice each roll into slices about 1/4-inch thick. Bake on an ungreased cookie sheet at 400 degrees F for about 10 minutes. Remove from cookie sheet and let cool. Store the cooled crackers in airtight containers in a cool place. They will keep for several weeks this way and if you freeze them, they will last indefinitely.

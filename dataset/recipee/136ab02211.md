### Ingredients

 - 240 g of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 60 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched

 - 200 ml of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 30 g of sugars, granulated

 - 25 g of butter, without salt

 - 4 g of salt, table

 - 5 g of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

### Instructions

Put all the ingredients in a bread machine, and turn on the "bread dough course" When it's done, take out the dough, shape into balls, and punch down to let the air out. Divide into 16 pieces. (I use a knife for that.) Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Reshape the dough and arrange them on the baking sheet so that they don't touch each other. Cover with a tightly wrung out kitchen towel, and let it sit for 15 minutes. Gently press down in the middle of each roll with the back of a knife to make a line. Put in the oven for 30 minutes at 40C for the second rising. Preheat the oven to 170C. In the meantime, dust the tops evenly with cake flour using a tea strainer. When the oven has heated up, turn down the temperature to 160C, and bake for 17 minutes to finish.

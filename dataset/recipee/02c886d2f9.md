### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of strawberries, raw

 - 3 ounce of strawberries, raw

 - 2-3 tablespoon of cornstarch

 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 teaspoon of strawberries, raw

### Instructions

add everything into a sauce pan and cook until it boils, stirring constantly. Continue to cook and stir until everything is dissolved and starts to thicken approximately 5 mintures. Cool in refrigerator until thick and set. prep time does not include time in the refrigerator. I have never tried this, but I think you could fold in 1 1/2 cups of whipped heavy cream to make a frosting. I also wonder how this would work in a pie -- if anyone is brave enough let me know how that works. ;-p.

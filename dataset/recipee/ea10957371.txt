To Temper Chocolate


Ingredients


 - 3 ounce of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022


Instructions: 

Have ready a 3- to 4-quart saucepan and a metal bowl large enough to fit on top. Make sure that when saucepan is filled one third full with water, bottom of bowl is not touching water. Chop chocolate into no larger than 1/4-inch dice and transfer three fourths to metal bowl. Fill saucepan one third full with water and bring water to a boil. Remove pan from heat. Set bowl with chocolate over pan (do not let bowl touch water) and melt chocolate, stirring, until a digital or chocolate thermometer inserted at least 1/2 inch into chocolate registers 118120F. for bittersweet chocolate or 116118F. for milk chocolate. (If chocolate does not reach desired temperature, remove bowl, return water in pan to a boil, and repeat procedure). Remove bowl from pan and cool chocolate by adding remaining chopped chocolate and stirring until smooth. Let chocolate cool until thermometer registers 80F. Return water in pan to a boil and remove from heat. Set bowl over pan and reheat melted chocolate, stirring until thermometer registers 8891F. for bittersweet chocolate or 8587F. for milk chocolate.

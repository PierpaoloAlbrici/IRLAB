Ingredients


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 3/4 cup of onions, raw


 - 3/4 cup of carrots, raw


 - 3/4 cup of celery, raw


 - 3/4 pound of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw


 - 4 cup of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, basil, dried


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, parsley, dried


 - 4 cup of soup, beef broth or bouillon canned, ready-to-serve


 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 2 cup of cheese, cheddar


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

Instructions: 

In a stockpot, saute the onions, carrots and celery in 1 tablespoon of butter for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, fry ground beef in a skillet until no longer pink. To the stockpot, add the cooked ground beef, potatoes, basil, parsley and beef broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes. Ten minutes before the soup is cooked, melt the 3 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan. Add the flour to the melted butter and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add the milk to the saucepan and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring until thickened. Remove from heat and stir in the shredded cheddar cheese until melted. Add the salt and pepper to the cheese sauce. Stir the cheese sauce mixture into the cooked soup. Remove from heat and add in the sour cream. Note* The original recipe called for chicken broth instead of beef broth which makes the soup a more cheesy color.

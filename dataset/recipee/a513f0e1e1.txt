Irish Soda Bread


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 1/2 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 12 cup of raisins, seeded


Instructions: 

Mix first 4 ingredients in a big bowl with a fork. Pour in buttermilk and raisins. Stir really fast until everything comes together like a ball of clay. Knead on a floured board for a few seconds. Place on lightly floured baking sheet. Cut a deep cross on top, all the way down the sides. Bake at 425 about 45 mins, until nicely browned and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Place on rack to cool, or better yet, eat right out of the oven!

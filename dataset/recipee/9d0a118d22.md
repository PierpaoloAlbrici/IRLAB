[9d0a118d22](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/breakfastbrunch/eggs-breakfastbrunch/brunch-bake/)

### Ingredients

 - 8 ounce of martha white foods, martha white's buttermilk biscuit mix, dry

 - 24 ounce of egg substitute, powder

 - 7 ounce of bacon, meatless

 - 1 cup of cheese, cheddar

 - 1 cup of cheese, mozzarella, low sodium

 - 1/2 cup of mushrooms, white, raw

 - 1/2 cup of onions, raw

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Arrange biscuits in a 13x9x2 baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. I used Grands Reduced Fat Buttermilk Biscuits. If you need it to be completely dairy free, you can use homemade biscuits or probably even just cubes of white bread (I havent tried it, but Im sure it can be done). In a bowl, combine the remaining ingredients; pour over the biscuits. Bake, uncovered, at 350 degrees for 30-35 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Serves 12.

Easiest BBQ Chicken Ever


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw


 - 15 ounce of sauce, barbecue


 - 7 1/2 ounce of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

This is so easy. Dump the chicken in the bottom of the slow cooker. Pour the bottle of BBQ sauce over it. Add water to the bottle so it is filled about half way. Shake up the bottle to get the stuff that sticks loosened and pour the bottle into the slow cooker again. Cook on low 6-8 hours. Serve over rice, noodles, biscuits, etc. I have tried it with Italian dressing too and it is good. I would think almost any sauce would work.

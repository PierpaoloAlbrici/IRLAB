Carmel Matzoh Crunch


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of sugars, brown


 - 6 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

Line a cookie sheet with foil and cover with baking parchment. Cover pan evenly with matzoh boards, using what you need and cutting pieces to fit spaces as evenly as possible. In a heavy saucepan, combine margerine and brown sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, for 3 to 5 minutes, until sugar desolves. Remove from heat and pour over matzoh. Bake at 375F (190C) for 15 minutes, checking every few minutes to be sure mixture does not burn. Remove from oven and sprinkle with chocolate bits. Let stand 5 minutes, then smear melted chocolate evenly. Chill in refrigerator until set. Makes 12 to 14 pieces, depending on size.

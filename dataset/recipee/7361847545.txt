How To Make Sushi Rice for Chirashi Sushi


Ingredients


 - 540 ml of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 600 ml of water, bottled, generic


 - 66 ml of vinegar, distilled


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Rinse the rice 1 hour before cooking, and drain in a sieve. Cook the rice in an equal amount of water or konbu seaweed dashi stock. Make the sushi vinegar. Put the ingredients in a small saucepan and heat up a bit and dissolve the sugar and salt. You can also just stir well until it dissolves without heating it up. Moisten the handai (wooden sushi rice tub) with water or vinegar. Put the freshly cooked rice in, drizzle on the sushi vinegar, and mix using a cut-and-fold motion. Cover the rice with a moistened and wrung out kitchen towel and leave for about a minute to allow the sushi vinegar to soak into the rice. Mix using a cut-and-fold motion while fanning the rice. Cool down to body temperature. Mix in the additional chirashi sushi ingredients at this point. Put the mixed rice into a large serving box (juubako). Decorate the top with kinshi tamago (shredded thin omelette), slices of kamaboko and snow peas. Your chirashi sushi is done.

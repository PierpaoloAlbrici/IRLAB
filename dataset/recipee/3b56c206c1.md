### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw

 - 2 cup of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry

 - 10 ounce of soup, cream of chicken, canned, condensed

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

### Instructions

Start with cooked, shredded chicken. You can either boil and shred it yourself or use canned chicken. I always have canned chicken on hand so that this recipe can be made on a whim. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Put the chicken in a 2-quart casserole dish. Combine the broth and soup in a medium saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil. Pour the broth mixture over the chicken. Make sure the butter is melted and buttermilk well shaken before continuing. In a separate medium bowl, mix the flour with the pepper. Stir in the melted butter and the buttermilk. Pour this mixture over the casserole and smooth the top; do not stir. Bake the casserole until the crust is brown and the filling beneath is hot and bubbly, 45 minutes.

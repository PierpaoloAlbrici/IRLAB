### Ingredients

 - 3 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 2 1/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1 teaspoon of honey

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

In a large bowl, combine 1/4 cup of flour(s) with water, yeast and salt and mix until well combined. Gradually add the remaining flour, mixing well. Add in the oil and honey, adding more water at this time if the dough is too dry, or more flour if the dough is too sticky. The dough is supposed to be very stiff. Knead the dough for approximately 10 minutes (see below), until a stiff, firm ball has formed. Allow the dough to rise until doubled in a covered bowl. Time will vary depending on room temperature, but should take approximately 2 hours. Knead the dough a second time and roll out until extremely thin. Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Spread the dough over a baking sheet and bake at 500 degrees for 3 minutes until the dough is brown. NOTE: You can mix knead the bread or use your food processor to knead dough for both kneading stages.

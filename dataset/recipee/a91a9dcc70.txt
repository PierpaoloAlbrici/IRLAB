Easy Green Beans


Ingredients


 - 12 pound of beans, snap, green, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of bacon, meatless


 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 2 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 2 teaspoon of sauce, worcestershire


Instructions: 

Steam or boil green beans until just underdone to your liking (I make mine crisp-tender). In a medium skillet, heat bacon fat over medium high heat. You only want the fat to coat the bottom of the pan, the beans should not be swimming in it. Add beans and saute, stirring to coat with bacon fat, about 2 minutes, until beans start to sizzle. Sprinkle with sugar and stir to coat, about 1 minute. Lower heat and add mustard and worcestershire sauce, stirring well, and saute for another 2 minutes or so. Serve hot.

Whole Wheat Cheese Crackers


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 5 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 8 ounce of cheese, cheddar


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 3 pinch of salt, table


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine all of the ingredients (everything except the extra salt for sprinkling) in a food processor and pulse until well combined and large crumbs are sticking together. Using your hands, create one large dough ball with the large crumbs (it should stick together easily). Roll dough very thinly onto a cutting board. You will need to work in batches based on how big your cutting board is. Cut rolled dough into small squares and gently lift squares using a knife. Place them on a silicone baking mat lined baking sheet. (If you dont have one of these, try using non-stick spray on a baking sheet. Report back and let us know how that works!) If youd like, you can press the edge of a fork in each cracker to create the classic Cheez-It design. Sprinkle crackers with extra salt. About 3 pinches should do, depending on how salty you like your crackers. Bake for 10 minutes or until firm and a golden color (some like them more brown than others). Cool and add more salt if needed. Store in an airtight container. Makes a whoooole lot!

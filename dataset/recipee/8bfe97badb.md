Preheat oven to 450F. BY HAND:. Stir dry ingredients together. Cut in cold butter with pastry blender, fork, or hands until mixture resembles a course meal. Mixing with a fork, add enough milk to form a soft dough. Work gently with fingers and turn out onto a lightly floured board. Quickly bag into 1/4-inch thickness. Fold over in 3 layers and pat again into 1/2-inch thickness. Cut out with desired cutter and bake, close together, on ungreased cookie sheet for 12-20 minutes, until evenly browned. BY PROCESSOR:. Place dry ingredients and butter in processor. Use quick pulses to create coarse, sandy texture. Add milk and process until ball is formed, adding more liquid if necessary.

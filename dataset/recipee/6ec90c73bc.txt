Hazelnut Frosting


Ingredients


 - 25 g of butter, without salt


 - 65 g of nuts, hazelnuts or filberts


 - 20 g of sugars, powdered


 - 0.5 g of salt, table


Instructions: 

Put the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and paddle on medium-high speed until it is completely smooth. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. This is a small amount of ingredients so use your granny mixer now or take on the task by hand in a medium bowl. Add the hazelnut paste, confectioners sugar, and salt and mix on high speed until the frosting is fluffy and has no lumps in it, 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and mix for 15 seconds, just to be sure everything is nice and smooth. Use immediately, or store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 month. Bring to room temperature before using.

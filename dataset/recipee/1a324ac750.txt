Fluffy & Moist Oatmeal Bread


Ingredients


 - 205 g of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 45 g of oats


 - 4 1/2 g of salt, table


 - 23 g of sugars, brown


 - 18 g of butter, without salt


 - 170 ml of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 3 g of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


Instructions: 

Place the dry yeast in it's specified space in the bread maker. Place the ingredients in the case and let the bread maker take care of the first rise. After the first rise, lightly remove the air and separate into 3 equal-sized pieces. Make into round shapes, then wrap and cover with a damp cloth and let sit for 15 minutes. Make sure the seams are facing down. Remove the air from each and stretch out. Fold the side closest to you and the far side into the center then roll it up. Place in the case with the seams facing down. What it looks like before the second rise, from the top and the side. And after the second rise. If your oven has a dough rising function, use that at 40C for 55 to 65 minutes. The highest part of the dough should be from 1 cm below the top of the pan to just below the top of the pan after the second rising. Apply the glaze after the second rise. Today I used a mixture of egg yolk and milk. Bake at 190C for 23 to 25 minutes and it's complete.

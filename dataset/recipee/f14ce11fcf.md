### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of carrots, raw

 - 1/2 cup of celery, raw

 - 1/2 cup of onions, raw

 - 1 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1 pound of peas, green, frozen, unprepared

 - 1 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Pour 2 quarts water into a large saucepan. Add the carrots, celery, onion, mustard, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes. Add the peas, bring the mixture back to a boil, and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Scoop out 3/4 cup of the cooked vegetables and set aside. Return the pan to the heat and puree the soup with an immersion blender. Alternatively, you can puree the mixture in batches in a blender or food processor. Simmer the pureed soup for 30 minutes. Give the soup one more pass with the blender. Stir in the reserved vegetables. Heat the broiler. Whip the cream to form soft peaks. Ladle the soup into shallow ovenproof bowls and top with a big spoonful of whipped cream. Sprinkle some sea salt over the cream. Place the bowls under the broiler and broil for 2 minutes or until the cream browns slightly. Serve at once.

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of sugars, brown

 - 23 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

 - 1/2 cup of syrups, corn, light

 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 teaspoon of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

 - 3 cup of oats

 - 13 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt

 - 1/4 cup of seeds, flaxseed

 - 1/2 cup of nuts, cashew nuts, raw

 - 1/2 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 1 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In large bowl, combine brown sugar, peanut butter, corn syrup, butter, vanilla, and coconut extract. Stir in oats and cereal. Add in all remaining ingredients. Press evenly into lightly greased 9x13 pan. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until light brown. Cool completely before cutting into bars (a pizza cutter works great for this). Note: toasting the nuts and coconut for 5-10 minutes heightens their flavour even more, if you want to take that extra step!

Easy Sugar Roasted Almonds


Ingredients


 - 4 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 cup of nuts, almonds


Instructions: 

Put all ingredients (except for the almonds) into a bowl and microwave at 600 Watt for 2 minutes. Add the almonds into the bowl and mix thoroughly. Put it another 2 minutes into the microwave oven. Mix again and microwave it another 2 minutes. Let the almonds cool on a baking sheet or paper. (I usually use a plastic tray.) Use two forks to separate sticking almonds immediately from each other. Enjoy!

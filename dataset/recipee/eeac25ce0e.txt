Cranberry Clusters


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 1/4 cup of cranberries, dried, sweetened


 - 1 1/4 cup of candies, semisweet chocolate


Instructions: 

Combine sugar and water in saucepan over medium heat. Stir until sugar is dissolved. Increase heat to high and, without stirring, cook until syrup is golden or until thermometer reads 250 degrees (hard ball stage). Remove from heat. Working quickly, drop 3 cranberries into caramel. Cranberries will almost come together on their own forming a cluster. Place clusters on wax paper to cool and harden. Caramel can cool quickly. I have actually placed the caramel on a heating pad to try to keep warm. You can try to gently reheat over stove but be careful not to burn. Melt chocolate in double boiler or bowl over simmering water. Remove bowl and place chocolate in room temperature bowl. Dip bottom of candies into chocolate and place on wax paper to cool. Store in airtight container or freeze. If your sugar coating is clear and sparkily only dip the bottom because they are beautiful. However, by the end of dipping, the sugar will become cloudy from crystalization. Just dip the whole thing. They are just as good.

Brussels Sprouts Lardons


Ingredients


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 4 ounce of bacon, meatless


 - 1 1/2 pound of brussels sprouts, raw


 - 34 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 34 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 34 cup of raisins, seeded


 - 1 3/4 cup of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry


Instructions: 

Heat the olive oil in a large (12-inch) saute pan and add the bacon. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until fat is rendered and the bacon is golden brown and crisp, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the bacon to a towel lined plate, leaving fat in pan. Add the sprouts, salt and pepper to the fat in the pan and saute over medium heat for about five minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the raisins and chicken stock. Lower the heat and cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the sprouts are tender when pierced with a knife, about ten to fifteen minutes. If the skillet becomes too dry, add a little chicken stock or water. Return the bacon to the pan, heat through, season to taste, and serve.

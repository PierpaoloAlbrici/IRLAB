Strawberry Chocolate Chip Frozen Yogurt


Ingredients

 - 2 cup of yogurt, vanilla, non-fat


 - 13 cup of honey


 - 1 teaspoon of beans, snap, green, raw


 - 1/4 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

This recipe will make 1 quart of frozen yogurt. Do-ahead note: Be sure that the bowl of your ice cream maker has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours prior to starting so that its nice and cold. Wash and hull the strawberries and cut them into large chunks. Add the strawberries into a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Push the strawberry puree into a bowl through a strainer to remove the seeds. (You can skip this step if seeds dont bother you.) In a blender add the Greek yogurt, strawberry puree, honey, and vanilla bean paste; blend until smooth. Pour the yogurt mixture into your frozen ice cream maker bowl and follow the ice cream maker instructions. Add in the chocolate chips when there is about 5 minutes to go in the ice cream maker. Serve the frozen yogurt immediately or store in an airtight container in the freezer.

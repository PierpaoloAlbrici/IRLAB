### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of oats

 - 1/2 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

 - 3 tablespoon of oil, canola

 - 1/2 cup of sugars, brown

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

### Instructions

Preheat your oven to 350. In a big mixing bowl, mix all of the ingredients together, except the honey. The peanut butter and sugar will clump together just break up the clumps with a spoon. I always leave a few, though they taste amazing. Not all of the oats will look like they have any peanut butter flavor, but trust me, once its done baking youll have some heavenly PB granola. Spread out the mixture onto a cookie sheet and bake for up to twenty minutes. After the first ten minutes, toss the granola so it bakes evenly. Drizzle the honey on top of the mixture at this time (I just eyeball the amount of honey), then put back in the oven for the remaining 10 minutes. Make sure to let the granola cool completely before storing in the fridge. Put your granola on top of oatmeal, yogurt, ice cream or eat as cereal. Or by the handful, like me.

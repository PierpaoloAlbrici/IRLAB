Bejinhos De Coco (Little Coconut Kisses) Recipe


Ingredients


 - 8 ounce of milk, canned, condensed, sweetened


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1/2 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Thoroughly butter a plastic tray or possibly cutting board and set aside. In a small heavy saucepan, combine the condensed lowfat milk and butter and cook over very low heat on a heatproof pad, stirring frequently, for about 15 min, till the mix thickens. Use a rubber spatula to reach all the way into the corners of the pan so which none of the mix scorches, as it is very delicate and easy to burn. If it seems to be getting too warm, remove it from the heat for 30 seconds to cold slightly. When the mix is quite thick, remove from the heat and cold for about 25 min, then stir in the coconut. Using a tiny ice-cream scoop (about 1 1/2 Tbsp. capacity) or possibly 2 tsp., scoop out little balls one by one and immediately drop them into a bowl of confectioners sugar. Roll around gently to coat them proportionately and transfer to the buttered tray. Continue till you have used all the mix and then stud each kiss with 2 or possibly 3 cloves. Store in a tightly covered container. This recipe yields about 18 kisses.

Pan De Polvo


Ingredients


 - 6 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 1/2 cup of lard


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, anise seed


 - 1 cup of spices, anise seed


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

Instructions: 

First make tea. Use 1 cup of water and 1 tbsp of Anise seed. Let it cool and set aside. Second get 1 tbsp of Anise seeds and crush in a mortar, set aside. Third make cinnamon sugar mix to dip hot cookies in, set aside. You are going to need 2 large bowls. In a large bowl, mix flour, salt and baking powder, set aside. In another large bowl, mix sugar, lard, crushed Anise seeds, and Anise tea until smooth. (may not need all of the tea, just eyeball it). Add flour mix, one cup at a time. Dough should be soft. SUGGESTION: Let dough rest for couple of hours or overnight. The Anise seeds will create a wonderful flavor! Lightly flour rolling surface. Roll out dough about 1/4 inch thickness. Use a heart shape cookie cutter or any small cookie cutter you like. Preheat oven to 400. Bake in an ungreased cookie sheet or stone for about 10 minutes or until edges are light brown. Remove from cookie sheet, let cookies cool about 2 minutes then roll warm cookie in cinnamon-sugar mix. (careful not to break cookie). *lard is recommended but you can use Mrs. Tucker's shortening, it works just as well. DO NOT USE OIL.

Hot Caramel


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 3 tablespoon of candies, caramels


Instructions: 

Heat milk and caramel in a small saucepan, stirring until fully incorporated. Heat until just shy of a boil. Pour in mugs, sit back and enjoy the creamy goodness! You can use store bought caramel if you like. For a wonderful and easy caramel sauce, I use Ina Gartens recipe. I add a bit extra vanilla since this household is crazy for it! You can store extra caramel in your fridge. For desserts, just heat it up a bit to easily drizzle and for additional hot caramel, use as is.

[63dd6e4976](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/151066-food-allergy-friendly-dairy-egg-free-cookies)

### Ingredients

 - 150 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched

 - 40 g of sugars, granulated

 - 30 g of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 10 g of water, bottled, generic

 - 10 g of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

### Instructions

In a bowl, mix the flour, sugar, vegetable oil, and water, and knead until the dough comes together. Once the dough has come together, divide in half, and add cocoa powder to half. Roll out the dough to your desired thickness and cut out using a cookie cutter. As baking powder is not added to the dough, the cookies will not rise during baking, so the thickness of the cookies will remain the same. Bake in the oven preheated to 170C for 20 minutes.

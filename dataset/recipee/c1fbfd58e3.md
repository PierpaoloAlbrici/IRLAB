### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of strawberries, raw

 - 4 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 1 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 1/2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 2 3/4 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

### Instructions

Combine strawberries, lemon juice, and 1/2 cup of sugar in a bowl and stir. Allow to sit for up to 2 hours. Strain berries and reserve the juices. Puree half the berries. In a medium bowl mix milk and remaining sugar until sugar is dissolved. Stir in heavy cream, leftover juice from the berry mixture, vanilla, and mashed strawberries. Turn on Cuisinart Ice Cream Machine and pour mixture into the frozen freezer bowl for about 20 minutes. Add the rest of the strawberries and mix for another 5 minutes. NOTE:. The ice cream will be very soft and creamy. We transferred ours to a container and stuck it in the freezer for about an hour to thicken it up a little the way we like it. I am looking forward to trying out some other new ice cream recipes now that I see just how easy it is to do! In fact, I have a container of blueberries in the kitchen that I think would be great in ice cream too!

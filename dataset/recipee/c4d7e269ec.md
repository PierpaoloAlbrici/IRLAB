### Ingredients

 - 23 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 13 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, rosemary, dried

 - 3 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 2 tablespoon of tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average

 - 1 tablespoon of onions, raw

 - 3 tablespoon of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Preheat the broiler. Sift the chickpea flour with the salt into a medium bowl. Slowly add 1/4 cup of the water, whisking constantly to form a paste. Beat with a wooden spoon until smooth. Whisk in the remaining 1/4 cup of water and let the batter stand at room temperature for 30 minutes, then stir in the rosemary. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a 12" nonstick ovenproof skillet. Stir the batter once, pour it into the skillet and drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil on top. Cook the pizza over moderately high heat until the bottom is golden and crisp and the top is almost set, 2 to 3 minutes. Burst any large air bubbles with the tip of a knife. Sprinkle the tomato, onion, Parmesan and pepper over the top, then place the skillet under the broiler and cook until the pizza is golden and crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. Slide the pizza onto a work surface, cut into wedges and serve hot.

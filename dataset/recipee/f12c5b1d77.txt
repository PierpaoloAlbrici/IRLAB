Basic Thin Crust Dough Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 2 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 2/3 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Bread Machine: Hot liquids to lukewarm, 110*. Add in ingredients to your bread machine in the order specified for your machine. Use dough cycle, that will knead the dougha nd allow it to rise one time. It is not necessary to let dough any longer which 1 hour. If your machine has a double kneading dough cycle (DAK And Welbilt ABM 100), remove the dough after 1 hour or possibly so and turn off your machine. Allowing the dough to knead the second time causes bubbles that are difficult to roll. Either acative dry or possibly rapid rise yeast may be used. It is not necessary to proof the yeast in water; just mix it in with the flour. Note To date I have over thirty five different pizza dough recipes, Want more e-mail me.

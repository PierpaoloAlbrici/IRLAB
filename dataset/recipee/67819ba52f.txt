Butterscotch Peach Jam


Ingredients


 - 6 cup of peaches, yellow, raw


 - 13 cup of lemon juice, raw


 - 5 cup of sugars, brown


Instructions: 

Prepare jars, lids & rings, and your BWB canner. In a large stainless steal pot combine the peaches and lemon juice. Over medium heat bring peaches to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cover for 10 minutes, stirring every 3 minutes to prevent scorching. Add the brown sugar. Increase heat to medium-high & stir constantly for 20 to 25 minutes. At this point if your peaches are to "chunky" you can mash lightly with a potato masher if that's your preference. Remove from heat and continue to stir for 3 or 4 minutes. Skim off any foam. Ladel jam into clean, hot jars leaving 1/4 inch head space. Wipe rims and seal. Process in a BWB canner for 10 minutes. Remove from canner and allow to cool on a clean towel.

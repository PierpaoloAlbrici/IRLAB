Fat Free Malt Loaf


Ingredients


 - 8 ounce of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 4 tablespoon of raisins, seeded


 - 3 tablespoon of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 150 ml of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 180 C or 350F Line the base of a 1lb loaf tin with greaseproof paper, cut to fit. Sieve flour and ground ginger into a bowl. Stir through bicarbonate of soda and sultanas, then bind ingredients with golden syrup and water - enough to make a fairly soft consistency. Turn the mixture into the tin and level off. Bake the loaf for about 55 minutes, or until risen and firm to the touch. Allow to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn on to a wire tray to cool completely. Serve sliced with tea.

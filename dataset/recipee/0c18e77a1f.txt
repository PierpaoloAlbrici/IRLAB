Kozinaki


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of nuts, almonds


 - 2 cup of honey


 - 6 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350F Spread the chopped nuts in a single layer in a pan and toast them in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes, turning them about with a spoon from time to time. Watch carefully for any sign of burning. In a heavy 2-quart pan, combine the honey and sugar and, stirring constantly, bring to a boil. When the syrup reaches 220F on a thermometer, lower the heat and stir in the nuts. Stirring often, cook for 15 minutes. Brush the inside of an 8- to 9-inch round pie tin or pan with cold water and pour in the nut mixture. Smooth the top and set aside, uncovered, to cool. When firm, dip the pan into hot water and invert a flat plate on top. Grasping the two firmly together, turn over; the candy should slide out in one piece. With a sharp knife dipped in hot water, cut into diamond shapes. The candy will keep at room temperature for about one week.

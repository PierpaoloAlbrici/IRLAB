### Ingredients

 - 4 pound of potatoes, raw, skin

 - 1 pound of celery, raw

 - 1 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Peel the potatoes, and cut into 1-inch pieces. Peel the celery root using a paring knife, following the shape of the root. Cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Place the potatoes and celery root in a small stockpot with enough water to cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer, and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain, return to the pot; place over low heat to dry out. Combine the cream, butter, salt, and pepper in a small saucepan, and place over medium heat until the butter is melted and the mixture comes to a simmer. Pour over the potato mixture, and combine, using a potato masher, until fluffy and smooth.

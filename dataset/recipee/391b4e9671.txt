Hazelnut Toffee


Ingredients


 - 2 teaspoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 3 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 tablespoon of syrups, corn, light


 - 13 cup of nuts, hazelnuts or filberts

Instructions: 

Line a 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. pan with foil; coat the foil with nonstick cooking spray and set aside. Butter the sides of a large heavy saucepan with 2 teaspoons butter. Cube remaining butter; place in pan. Add the sugar, water and corn syrup. Cook and stir until mixture turns golden brown and a candy thermometer reads 300 (hard crack stage). Remove from the heat; stir in hazelnuts. Pour into prepared pan without scraping; spread evenly. Let stand at room temperature until cool, about 1 hour. In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the chocolate chips. Let stand for 1 hour. Break into bite-sized pieces. Store in the refrigerator. Yield: 1-3/4 pounds. Note: We recommend that you test your candy thermometer before each use by bringing water to a boil; the thermometer should read 212. Adjust your recipe temperature up or down based on your test.

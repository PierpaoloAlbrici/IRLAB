Griddle Scones


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 cup of lard


 - 1 tablespoon of syrups, corn, light


 - 1 1/2 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, sugar, and salt. Cut in the shortening with a fork, pastry blender, or by pinching between your fingers. Make a well in the center, and pour in the corn syrup and buttermilk. Stir with a sturdy spoon to form a soft dough. Divide the dough in half, and pat out into 3/4 inch thick circles on a floured surface. Cut each circle into 6 wedges. Heat a griddle over medium heat, and grease lightly with cooking spray or oil. Cook scones on each side, then stand them on edge, and cook all three edges. Cool on a wire rack.

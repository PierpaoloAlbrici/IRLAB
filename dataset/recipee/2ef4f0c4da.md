### Ingredients

 - 3 ounce of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)

 - 1 cup of oil, corn, peanut, and olive

 - 4 ounce of butter, without salt

 - 16 ounce of sugars, brown

 - 14 cup of syrups, corn, light

 - 12 teaspoon of vanilla extract

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Spray a pan with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper with nonstick spray. Combine the popcorn and peanuts in a large mixing bowl and set aside. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the brown sugar, corn syrup and vanilla and stir until combined. Heat the mixture until it reaches 250 degrees F, approximately 10 minutes. Pour the syrup over the popcorn and stir to combine. You will need to work quickly because the syrup hardens rapidly. Spread the mixture onto the prepared sheet pan and bake in the oven for 1 hour. (I have never baked mine and still think it comes out tasting wonderful but wanted to include this step as this is how they made it on tv). Cool completely. Break into pieces and serve immediately or store in an airtight container for 2 to 3 days.

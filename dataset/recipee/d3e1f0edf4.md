In mixer bowl, stir together 3/4 cup all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, salt and yeast. Add water; mix at low speed with paddle for 2 minutes. Add remaining whole wheat flour; mix at medium speed until blended. Add remaining all-purpose flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until soft dough forms. (You may not need to add all the all-purpose flour; dough should be soft but not sticky. ). With dough hook, knead dough at medium speed for about 8 minutes or until elastic. Form dough into ball and place in lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap; let rise in warm place until doubled in bulk. Remove plastic; punch down dough with your fist. Cover and let rise 30 minutes more. Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Divide dough into 6 pieces; form each piece into a ball. Cover with a towel and let rest for 5 minutes. Roll 1 piece of dough as thin as possible. With your hands, lift and stretch dough as thin as you can without tearing, rotating dough as you work, until round is about 8 inches in diameter. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon almonds, pressing them in gently. Repeat with remaining dough to make 6 rounds. Place rounds on baking sheets; bake for about 10 minutes or until brown in spots.

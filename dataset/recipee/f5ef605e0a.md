### Ingredients

 - 4 1/2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 10.0 ounce of candies, marshmallows

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 2 dash of salt, table

 - 6 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt

### Instructions

Melt 4 tablespoons of butter in a 5 qt. (or larger) pot on stovetop on low heat Once butter is melted, pour entire bag of marshmallows in at once and stir, coating them all with butter Continue stirring marshmallows until they are all melted and creamy. *You have to continually stir them to prevent scorching and/or stiffness Once marshmallows are melted, remove from heat and stir in vanilla and salt Pour Rice Krispies in all at once and stir to coat them evenly with marshmallow cream. *Be careful to not over stir and crush cereal. I use more like a folding method Pour mixture into a greased 9x12 cake pan. *I spray my pan with veggie or canola oil Butter your hands with the remaining butter and remove mixture clumps left in pot and/or on spoon. Pat the mixture down evenly in the pan Let cool for at least and hour before cutting or covering. Store covered at room temp, do NOT refridgerate

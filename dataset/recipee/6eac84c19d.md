### Ingredients

 - 300 g of beans, kidney, all types, mature seeds, raw

 - 200 g of sugars, granulated

 - 1/3 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Wash the beans and then soak in 4 cups of water for 8 hours. Put the beans and the water they were soaked in into a pot. Bring to a boil on high heat, uncovered. Once boiling, lower the heat to low and simmer for 3-4 minutes. Put the beans in a colander and drain. Add the beans and the 3 cups of water to a pressure cooker and turn the heat to high. Once pressurized, lower the heat to low and cook for 4 more minutes. Turn off the heat and let it sit until the pressure is released. Mash about 2 ladles of beans through a strainer and then return to the pot. Add sugar and turn the heat to medium. Cook, stirring and mashing the beans, for 10 minutes. Lastly, add the salt and give it a quick stir. All done. Or in a chilled pudding. Or toss the beans into bread dough and bake loaves

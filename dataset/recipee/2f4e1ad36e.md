### Ingredients

 - 100 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 35 g of sugars, granulated

 - 25 g of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 35 g of oil, canola

### Instructions

Put the flour, sugar and cocoa powder in a bowl. Stir with a whisk, incorporating air to mix everything thoroughly. You don't need to sift the dry ingredients, but mix really well until there is no lump in the mixture. Drizzle the canola oil over the flour mixture, and mix by hand. Knead the dough to spread the oil evenly. Preheat the oven to 180C. The dough will be very crumbly, so put a thumb-sized portion on your palm, and squeeze hard to shape the dough. It's easy to break apart, but you will get a hang of shaping it after a few attempts. Place the shaped dough on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, and bake for about 10 minutes at 180C. Adjust the baking time depending on the thickness of the dough. After baking, cool the cookies on the baking tray, or on the parchment paper, and they are ready. The cookies fall apart easily since they are egg-free, so you had better not touch them until they cool.

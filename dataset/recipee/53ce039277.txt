Bahamas Bread


Ingredients


 - 34 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 12 cup of oats


 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of molasses


 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

Instructions: 

Mix all the ingredients together and knead for thirty to forty seconds. Let rise (about forty minutes) and knock down and knead for thirty seconds. Repeat. (Or let the bread machine do all the kneading and timing for you and go beach combing until it's time to cook the dough!) Allow final rise in a bread pan, about forty minutes, and preheat oven to 425 f. Place in oven and decrease temperature to 350 f. Bake for thirty minutes.

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F Divide the oats between two 9*13 pans, and roast for 20 minutes, stirring every five minutes. If you're substituting smaller oats, roast for a shorted period and watch them carefully. Remove the oats from the oven and put in a large bowl.

Package the cereal in ziplock bags as quick as you can to preserve freshness.

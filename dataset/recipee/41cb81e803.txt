Peanut Butter Sesame Seed Balls


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/4 cup of oats


 - 3 tablespoon of seeds, flaxseed


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2/3 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 1/2 cup of honey


 - 1/2 cup of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried


Instructions: 

Whisk flour, oats, ground flax seed, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl; add peanut butter and honey and mix until thoroughly combined. Shape mixture into teaspoon-size balls. Pour about 1/2 the sesame seeds into a large frying pan and cook over low heat, stirring or shaking the pan every minute until fragrant and toasted, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer toasted seeds to a bowl and toast remaining sesame seeds. Spread toasted seeds into a wide, shallow bowl. Roll peanut butter balls in the toasted sesame seeds to evenly coat.

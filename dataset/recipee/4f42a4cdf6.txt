Nana Reinhart's Irish Soda Bread


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 cup of raisins, seeded


 - 1 1/2 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Mix the first 5 ingredients. Add raisins. Add buttermilk. Mix until dough forms. Form into a ball and plop it onto a lightly floured baking pan or stone. Cut top of dough crisscross with knife. Brush with buttermilk. Bake at 375 for one hour. If bread gets too brown, cover with foil. Because all ovens are different, please watch. When toothpick inserted in middle comes out clean, it's done. I found that cutting the bread when warm is easier than when cooled completely.

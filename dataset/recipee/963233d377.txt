French Almonds


Ingredients


 - 2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 2 cup of nuts, almonds


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 350F (175C). In a small skillet, heat the water and sugar, stirring a bit, just until it begins to boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the almonds to coat them with the syrup. Spread the almonds on a nonstick baking sheet, or a baking sheet lined with a silicone baking mat. Bake for 20 minutes, stirring twice during baking and separating any clumps. Remove from the oven when the almonds are a medium golden brown. Cool completely. For Candied Oats, toast 1 cup (100 g) rolled oats in a small baking pan in a 350F (175C) oven for 7 minutes. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons of water, 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar, and a big pinch of cinnamon in a small saucepan. Mix the syrup with the oats, spread the mixture on a nonstick baking sheet, and bake for 30 minutes, stirring a few times during baking. Store French Almonds in an airtight container for up to 1 week.

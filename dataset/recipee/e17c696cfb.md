### Ingredients

 - 1 pint of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

### Instructions

Pour cream into a metal bowl, and place over a pan of simmering water. Heat until warm. Stir in the cream of tartar, and continue to heat and stir until the temperature reaches 180 degrees F. Remove from the heat. Line a colander or strainer with cheesecloth, and place over a bowl. Paper towels also seem to work well. Pour the mixture into the strainer, and let it drain for several hours, or overnight in the refrigerator. Spoon the resulting cheese into a clean container and use within one week. Store in the refrigerator.

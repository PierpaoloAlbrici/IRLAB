Millionaires Shortbread or Creamy Caramel and Oat Squares


Ingredients


 - 3 1/2 ounce of butter, without salt


 - 4 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 4 1/2 ounce of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 1/2 ounce of oats


 - 1 ounce of butter, without salt


 - 1 ounce of sugars, granulated


 - 7 fl. oz of milk, canned, condensed, sweetened


 - 3 1/2 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

Beat the butter and sugar until fluffy, and then beat in the flour and oats. Press the mixture into an 8" square tin, and bake at Gas mark 4 for 25 minutes until golden. Allow to cool. For the caramel filling, mix all of the ingredients in a pan until well combined and boil over a low heat until thick-about 3-4 minutes. Pour over the biscuit base and leave to set. Melt the chocolate and pour over the caramel, leave to set, but just before it gets too hard, mark out your portions. If you do it when completely set, the chocolate shatters.

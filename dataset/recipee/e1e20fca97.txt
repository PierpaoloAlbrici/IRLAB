Yeast Free Sugar Free Oil Free Pumpkin Whole Wheat Bread


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 14 cup of pumpkin, raw


Instructions: 

Mix dry ingredients. Do not sift the flour! Mix liquids and add to dry. Stir until there is no more dry flour. Depending on the humidity of the air where you live you may need a little bit more or less liquid. The dough should be moist but not sticky. It may take a few minutes for the flour to fully absorb the liquid, so don't rush to add liquid or flour to it. Score lightly the surface in a diamond or X shape to prevent splitting of the crust. It is important not to overwork the dough. Shape into a ball or an oval, with oiled hands. Place in clean Bread Pan. Bake for 40 minutes at 400F.

### Ingredients

 - 2 tablespoon of beans, snap, green, raw

 - 3/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Place pour-over filter holder on top of coffee mug or serving vessel. Moisten coffee filter with tap water; place in holder. Add coffee grounds to filter holder. Slowly pour small amount of boiling water over grounds, adding just enough water to evenly moisten grounds. Let stand 30 sec. Gradually add remaining water, stopping occasionally to allow coffee grounds to completely absorb water. (This helps with the flavor development of the brewed coffee.) Remove filter holder when coffee stops dripping.

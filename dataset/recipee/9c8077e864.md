### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of oats

 - 2 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

 - 2 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 34 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 12 cup of honey

 - 1 1/2 cup of apricots, dried, sulfured, uncooked

 - 1 cup of figs, dried, uncooked

 - 1 cup of cranberries, dried, sweetened

 - 1 cup of nuts, cashew nuts, raw

### Instructions

Preheat over to 350 degrees. Toss, oats, coconut and almonds together in large bowl and set aside. Whisk together the oil and honey in small bowl and pour over the oat mixture and stir with wooden spoon until all the oats, coconut and nuts are coated. Pour into a 13x9 baking pan and bake. Stir occasionally with spatula until mixture turns a nice golden brown about 45 minutes. Remove granola from oven and allow to cool, stirring occasionally. Add the apricots, figs, cranberries and cashews. You can put whatever mix of dried fruit in that you please. I have even started to put in a cup of dark chocolate chips after the oats mix has cooled. Great snack! Store cooled granola in airtight container.

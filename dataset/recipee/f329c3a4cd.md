### Ingredients

 - 2 tablespoon of jams and preserves, apricot

 - 4 tablespoon of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat

 - 120 ml of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

This time I used the strawberry sauce from "A Small Amount of Strawberry Sauce in a Microwave". You can also use strawberry jam. If the jam contains large pieces of fruit, use a fork or spoon to mash them up. Mix the strawberry sauce (or strawberry jam) with yogurt. Add milk and mix. Then it's done.

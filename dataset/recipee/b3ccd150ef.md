[b3ccd150ef](http://www.food.com/recipe/chocolate-glaze-for-cakes-that-hardens-315210)

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 14 cup of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt

 - 3 tablespoon of syrups, corn, light

 - 2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 teaspoon of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Make certain that the cake has been chilled in the fridge before starting the glaze. In a 4-cup pyrex bowl or measuring cup or a microwave-safe bowl combine all ingredients. Microwave on HIGH for about 2 minutes or until melted and smooth, removing once to stir. Allow to sit at room temperature for about 5 minutes to allow to thicken enough so that it will not run off the cake (test out the consistency by drizzling a small amount over the top of the cake). Drizzle over top of the cold cake, then refrigerate (the glaze will harden even more when refrigerated).

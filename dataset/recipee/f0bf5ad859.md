### Ingredients

 - 4 ounce of butter, without salt

 - 4 ounce of sugars, granulated

 - 3 tablespoon of honey

 - 6-8 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

### Instructions

Melt butter, sugar and honey in a large pot. Bring to the boil. Boil for 1 to 2 minutes stirring constantly to prevent burning. The longer you cook your toffee for, the crunchier your cakes will be. Remove from the heat and working quickly, add rice bubbles and press into a greased tin. Mark into squares while still warm.

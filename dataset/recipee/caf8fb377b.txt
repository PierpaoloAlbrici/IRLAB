Roasted Okra


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of okra, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Rinse and dry okra. If its not completely dry, the olive oil and salt wont stick. Chop off the top and then slice the okra lengthwise. Slicing the okra allows the inside seeds to become crisp. It also removes even the smallest hint of sliminess that many find unpalatable about okra. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt, and mix together so the okra glistens with olive oil on all sides and the salt is evenly distributed. Broil on both sides until equally crispy and browned, about 5 minutes per side. Every oven is different, so keep an eye on them to make sure they dont burn. Adjust the amount as needed. These are so good that you may find that 1 pound isnt enough!

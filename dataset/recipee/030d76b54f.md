### Ingredients

 - 1/2 pound of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 2 tablespoon of cornstarch

 - 2 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 275F. In large bowl, cream butter, sugar and cornstarch. Mixing with your hands (or get your kids to do it, theyll LOVE it), add flour a little at a time just until the dough no longer sticks to your fingers. You may not use all of the flourthis is okay. Gather dough into a ball and roll out on a lightly floured surface to 1/2-inch thickness. Use a 1 to 2-inch cookie cutter to cut out rounds. Gather scraps, form into ball and roll out again. Cut out more cookies. Repeat until all dough is used. Bake for approximately 30 minutes or until edges just begin to brown. Cool on a cooling rack and store in an airtight container.

Vanilla Frosting Surprise (Healthy Secret Ingredient)


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of cheese, cottage, creamed, large or small curd


 - 4 ounce of cheese, neufchatel


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, powdered


 - 4 teaspoon of cornstarch


 - 2 teaspoon of sweetener, herbal extract powder from stevia leaf


 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Note: Prep time does not include chill time. If there are obvious pools of water in the cottage cheese, you may pour out the excess, but dont press to drain out liquid. Place cottage cheese into a blender and puree until at least 90% smooth. You might need to stop the blender a few to times to scrape and stir to ensure that everything is pureed. Add the remaining ingredients. Puree until smooth and creamy, stopping to scrape if needed. Frosting will be smooth and somewhat runny. Refrigerate in a shallow container (more surface area to expedite chilling) for at least 1 hour to firm up, longer is better. Store refrigerated. Makes about 2 1/4 cups.

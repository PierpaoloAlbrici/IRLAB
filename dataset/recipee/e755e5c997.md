### Ingredients

 - 1 1/2 pound of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 3/4 cup of vinegar, balsamic

 - 8 ounce of mushrooms, white, raw

### Instructions

Season entire surface of tenderloin with salt and pepper. Heat oil and garlic in oven-proof skillet or possibly flame-proof shallow roasting pan over medium-high heat. Add in meat, turning to brown all sides. Place in a 425 degree oven for 15 to 20 min or possibly till internal temperatures reaches 145 degrees for medium-rare. Remove from oven. Place meat on cutting board and cover with foil. Place pan over high heat; add in vinegar and stir to remove browned bits from pan. Cook for 4 to 5 min or possibly till reduced by half. Add in mushrooms; cook for 2 min or possibly till mushrooms are tender. Cut meat into 1/2-inch thick slices. Spoon mushrooms and sauce over each serving. NOTES : Start with heat-in-your-mouth medallions of beef tenderloin. Then pair them with the sweet, yet robust flavor of this classic, dark Italian vinegar, fresh mushrooms, and of course, garlic! It's wonderful!

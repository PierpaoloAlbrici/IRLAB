Congee/ Kanji/ Jook/ Rice Gruel


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 8 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Add rice and water to VERY large pan with vented lid. We use a HUGE bubble-top pan we got from Ikea. It is one of the few that doesn't boil over and spew everywhere for this operation. It is an operation, it takes awhile for this to cook down! You'll need to keep stirring it so that it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan and burn! If your hungry, smelling this cook will just make you HUNGRIER and it takes like 3 hours to cook. It also smells WAY better than it tastes LOL It is PRETTY darn bland!I use to have it in the mornings with Agave Syrup and maybe some cinnamon. Lately I've just been having it with salt because I'm healing I also add it to my meals, because it helps aid in my digestion. So I guess I eat it like Grits! Rice Grits!!! New name! haha I changed it! Nobody knows what gruel is and it sounds so bad! even tho its just hot cereal! So I have Rice Grits with EVERYTHING as a side dish. Or I eat it as a snack, just to keep me goin', like someone would eat oatmeal. I cannot eat Gluten or Corn, so this is my alternative option :) You can use what you make to make soup out of as well... There are a couple wasy to do this, I used to cook the Jook down to a watery consistency and spoon out the thicker part with a slotted spoon. This gave me my Rice Grits to have in the fridge to eat, then I would add more water to the soupy mixture that was left and add ingredients to make soup, mostly vegetables, oo and sweet potatoes!!! mmm, im gonna make some tomorrow! :) You can also just double the water, not to start with, but cook down, add more and then cook again with vegetables. This of course will make a thicker ricier soup. I also use my leftovers to make soup base. After I am done eating them as Grits, i just add them to water with veggies!

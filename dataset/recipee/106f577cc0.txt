Chocolate or Carob Pudding (Vegan, Light)


Ingredients


 - 2 tablespoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


 - 3 tablespoon of cornstarch


 - 2 cup of beverages, almond milk, unsweetened, shelf stable


 - 3-4 tablespoon of sweetener, syrup, agave


 - 14 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 teaspoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Blend carob or cocoa powder with cornstarch in saucepan by mashing them together with a fork to flatten any small lumps. Add small amounts of almond milk gradually, blending well after each addition. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently. You can start at a higher heat for the first one or two minutes, but keep stirring and lower the heat so as not to scorch the pudding at the bottom. You can add the vanilla if using, at this point. Bring to a boil, lower heat, and boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly. You may add your sweetener of choice now, or after pudding is cooked. Add butter or coconut oil, if using, and stir to melt and blend. (I prefer to add virgin coconut oil at this point so that it doesn't cook). Chill or serve warm.

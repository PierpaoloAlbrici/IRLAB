### Ingredients

 - 14 cup of sugars, brown

 - 14 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 325F In a medium bowl, beat butter or margarine and brown sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Stir in vanilla. Add flour and salt to the butter and blend well. With a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface, roll out dough 1/4-inch thick. Cut out cookies using a 3 inch Shamrock cookie cutter and place 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Re-roll scraps. Sprinkle green sugar crystals on each cookie. Bake 20 to 25 minutes, until cookies are pale golden, not brown. Let stand 2 minutes. Remove to a rack and let cool completely.

Decadent Raspberry Sauce


Ingredients


 - 1 pint of raspberries, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of cornstarch


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

In a small saucepan, add cornstarch and sugar. Put enough warm water on top to cover the bottom of the pan (1/4 cup or so, depending on how big your pan is). This is just to dissolve the cornstarch and sugar. Add fresh or frozen raspberries. Over medium heat, cook down your raspberries, stirring every few minutes. The entire process will take ten to fifteen minutes. Make sure to let the sauce reach a boil to activate the cornstarch. Your raspberries should be broken down by that time. Turn off the heat. Use a strainer to remove the seeds from the sauce. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator. When serving, warm sauce in microwave for 30 seconds. Use a small condiment bottle or spoon to add sauce to each plate of cake/pie youre serving. Tastes great with chocolate! And all of your guests will assume youre an all-star chef!

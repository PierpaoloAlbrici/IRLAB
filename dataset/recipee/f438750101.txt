Polenta


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 cup of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry


 - 1 3/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 1/4 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow


 - 12 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard


Instructions: 

In a 3-quart saucepan, heat broth and water to boiling; slowly stir in the cornmeal, 1/4 cup at a time. Bring mixture to boiling; reduce heat to very low. Cover and cook for 20 minutes, stirring often. Stir in the cheese. Dump on a greased plate, let harden. Slice and top with whatever you like. I fry hot Italian sausage, a small head of cabbage (chopped), add to the sausage pan after removing the sausage. Cook the cabbage until tender. Add a can (15oz.) Hunts tomato sauce (lasagna style) and a 14 oz. jar of pasta sauce, put the sausage back in the pan and simmer for 20 minutes. Pour this over slices of polenta.

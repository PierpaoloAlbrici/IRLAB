### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

 - 14 ounce of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022

 - 1 3/4 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 3/4 cup of orange juice, raw

 - 1/2 cup of raisins, seeded

### Instructions

Center a rack in the oven and preheat to 325F. Place the coconut on a baking sheet and toast for 4 to 5 minutes, until light golden brown, stirring after each minute. Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature on a rack. Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper. Place a 4 1/2 by 14-inch flan form in the center of the baking sheet. Melt and temper the chocolate (see pages 2530). In a 2-quart mixing bowl, combine the coconut, almonds, orange peel, and raisins; toss to blend evenly. Pour this mixture into the tempered chocolate and stir to coat it completely. Pour the chocolate mixture into the flan form and use a rubber spatula to spread it evenly and smoothly. Chill in the refrigerator until slightly set (about 15 minutes). Remove from the refrigerator and score the candy into fourteen 1-inch-wide bars. Score each bar in half to indicate 1 by 2-inch bars. Return the candy to the refrigerator to set completely (about 1 hour). Remove the candy from the refrigerator and let it stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. With a sharp, thin-bladed knife, cut around the rim of the flan form to remove it, then cut the candy into the marked pieces. Place each bar in a paper candy cup. In a tightly covered container wrapped in several layers of aluminum foil, the bars will keep for 1 month in the refrigerator or 2 months in the freezer. They are best served at room temperature. Substitute any nuts for the almonds. Substitute other dried fruits for the candied orange peel and raisins. White Chocolate California Fruit and Nut Bars: Substitute white chocolate for the bittersweet chocolate. California Fruit and Nut Nibby Chocolate Bars: Substitute cacao nibs for the raisins. California Fruit and Nut Chocolate Squares: Line an 8-inch-square baking pan with aluminum foil that extends over the sides. Pour the chocolate, fruit, and nut mixture into the pan, chill, and cut into sixty-four 1-inch squares instead of bars.

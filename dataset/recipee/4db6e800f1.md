### Ingredients

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 2 cup of onions, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 12 teaspoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

 - 2 tablespoon of vinegar, balsamic

 - 2 tablespoon of vinegar, red wine

 - 2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook for 5-8 minutes, until tender and translucent. Add the sugar and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15-20 minutes, until golden brown. Add remaining ingredients and cook, stirring often to avoid scorching, for 20 minutes, or until thick and jamlike. The slower it is cooked, the richer the jam will be. Store tightly covered in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

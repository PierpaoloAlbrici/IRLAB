### Ingredients

 - 40 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 20 g of oats

 - 2 g of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1 g of salt, table

 - 30 g of sugars, brown

 - 25 g of butter, without salt

 - 0.5 g of vanilla extract

### Instructions

In a bowl combine the flour, oats, cinnamon, salt, and brown sugar with a spoon or spatula until the dry ingredients are incorporated. Pour in the melted butter and vanilla and toss the mixture until almond-size dark oat clusters form. If youre making the pie the same day, the streusel can wait out on the counter. If youre making the streusel in advance, transfer it to an airtight container and store in the fridge or freezer for up to 2 weeks.

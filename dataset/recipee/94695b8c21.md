### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of alcoholic beverage, beer, regular, all

 - 10 ounce of sauerkraut, canned, solids and liquids

 - 12 ounce of tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average

 - 2 cup of cabbage, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder

### Instructions

Layer bottom of a crockpot with the kraut. Top with cabbage and garlic. Gently mix. Cut sausage into 4 inch pieces. If using beer barons, cut in half. Pour tomato juice over all and do not mix. Turn crockpot to low and cook for 3 to 5 hours. DO NOT MIX. Add additional tomato juice as needed to keep moist or the kraut will burn. Serve sausage on hard rolls or buns covered with the kraut mixture and your favorite condiments. Can also be prepared on a grill cooked over low indirect heat in a covered disposable aluminum pan.

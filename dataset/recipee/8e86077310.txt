Instructions: 

This is on the spicier side. If you do not want it as spicy, decrease the Red Pepper Flake to 1 teaspoon and only use 4 teaspoons of Chili Powder. If you are using for Chili (I posted a recipe)....use 2 tablespoons for 1 pound of ground beef/beef stew meat. Adjust accordingly for more meat. I.e. - 4 tablespoons for 2 pounds of meat.

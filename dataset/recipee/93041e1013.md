 - 5 pound of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw

 - 30 ounce of apricots, dried, sulfured, uncooked

 - 2 teaspoon of onions, raw

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, marjoram, dried

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, basil, dried

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 13 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Trim fat from pot-roast and het in Dutch oven or electric frying-pan to obtain 2 tablespoon drippings. Discard remaining fat. Brown meat in drippings, on both sides. Pour off drippings. Drain Apricots reserving liquid to pour over beef. Sprinkle onion, majoram, basil and pepper on both sides of beef. Cover tightly and cook slowly 2 to 3 hours, until tender. Add herry and salt; cook uncovered 30 minutes or until liquid has cooked down to a syrup, basting meat frequently. Place pot-roast on platter; spoon syrup over it. (Any remaining syrup may be served as an accompaniment.) Arrange apricots around pot-roast and garnish with parsley. To serve, slice across the grain of meat.

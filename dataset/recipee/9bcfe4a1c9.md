### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 3 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1 cup of dates, deglet noor

 - 1 cup of nuts, walnuts, english

 - 2 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. For the Dough: Mix the Part 1 ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Mix the Part 2 ingredients in another large bowl. Now add the Part 2 to the Part 1 ingredients. Mix well. For the Syrup: Mix all the syrup ingredients in a non-reactive sauce pan. Bring the syrup to a fast boil. Pour the syrup into a large oven-safe dish. (We use a large deep Visions cookware casserole dish) Baking: Put the dough mixture into the middle of the syrup. Just mound it there. DO NOT SPREAD IT. Take a sheet of foil and double it up and place on the center rack. This is to protect from any run off or overflow. Place the dish into the oven on center rack on top of foil. Bake for 35 minutes. Remove, cover, and let cool. Serve in small portions with Whipped cream, it will cut the sweetness and complement the richness best.

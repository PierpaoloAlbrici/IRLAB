Instructions: 

Combine first five ingredients in large bowl. Cut in margarine with pastry blender until mixture is crumbly. Add milk and peaches, stirring just until blended. Spoon into greased muffin cups (paper liners do not work very well with this recipe). Sprinkle with topping mixture. Bake at 400F for 20-25 minutes or until set and golden.

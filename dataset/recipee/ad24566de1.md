### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

 - 1 tablespoon of rice flour, white, unenriched

 - 1 cup of nuts, pecans

 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

### Instructions

Whisk together the milk, cream and rice flour/cornstarch in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan on medium heat. Bring to a slow boil, stirring almost constantly to prevent scorching. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer the mixture until it is the colour and consistency of cream and reduces to about 3 1/2 cups of liquid. (This will take approximately 45 minutes.) Meanwhile, chop half of the pecans very finely and the other half roughly. Remove the cream/milk mixture from the heat and let it cool for 15 minutes. Stir in the sugar, pecans and vanilla. Pour into ramekins or small bowls. Allow it to cool completely on the countertop before covering tightly with plastic wrap and freezing for at least 6 hours before serving. Remove from the freezer 5-10 minutes before serving. Notes: Roast raw pecans in a 325 degrees F oven for 8-10 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool.

Crescent Cookies


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 5 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 teaspoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, powdered


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 F. In the bowl of your stand mixer using paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugar. Add in the vanilla and water and mix together. Stir in flour and salt. Then fold in the pecans, making sure they are evenly distributed. Using walnut-sized portions, roll dough into crescent or round ball shapes. Place them on a parchment lined baking sheet, with just a little space between each. Bake for 10 minutes at 350 F. Remove from oven. While still warm, roll in the powdered sugar.

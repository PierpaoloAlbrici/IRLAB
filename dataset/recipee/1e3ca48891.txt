Tropical Granola Bars


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of oats

 - 1 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


 - 12 cup of papayas, raw


 - 12 cup of pineapple, raw, all varieties


 - 1 cup of nuts, almonds

Instructions: 

Mix dry ingredients and then add wet ingredients. Be sure that you mix everything thoroughly. You can use your hands for this if you want. Press (firmly) into a greased jelly roll pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 15-18 minutes. Cut into pieces as soon as you take them out of the oven. A pizza cutter works well for this step. Cool and wrap. May be frozen. I wrap each piece in wax paper and then freeze them in a ziplock bag. Note: If you can't find almond flour, you can use your blender or food processor to finely grind almonds and get a similar product. All the flours are interchangeable, so use what you like or have on hand. The mixture I have here does not destroy the tropical flavors, but feel free to experiment. The flours are just a binder that add nutrients.

On the Go Potato Cups #SP5


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of denny's, hash browns


 - 14 cup of peppers, sweet, green, raw


 - 14 cup of onions, spring or scallions (includes tops and bulb), raw


 - 2 cup of egg substitute, powder


 - 14 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard


Instructions: 

Start with heating your oven to 350 degrees. Then take a 12 cup muffin pan and add cupcake liners. (I spray the insides of the liners with a little cooking spray to avoid sticking). In a large bowl add all five ingredients listed above,stir together, then fill the muffin cups about 3/4th full. Bake for about 25 minutes (the center of the cup should be done) then take cups out of the pan and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes. On the go potato cups are ready to eat.

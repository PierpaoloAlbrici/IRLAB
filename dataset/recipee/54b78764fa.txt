Brown Sugar N Cinnamon Butter


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 14 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


Instructions: 

Place butter, brown sugar and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Mix until thoroughly blended. Place on edge of a sheet of parchment or wax paper (about 1 foot long) and roll tightly. Twist both ends of paper and place in freezer until firm, about one hours. After 30 minutes, it will be easier to get a more perfect cylinder shape by re-rolling the half firm butter in the paper and popping back in the freezer.

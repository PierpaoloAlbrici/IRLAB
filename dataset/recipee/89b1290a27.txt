Churros


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/8 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 quart of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Combine flour and salt; set aside. Bring water to full rolling boil in large saucepan. Remove from heat. Add flour mixture all at once; stir until well blended. Cool 5 min. Meanwhile, place a medium-size star tip in pastry bag. (Or, use cookie press fitted with a star-shaped attachment.) Place dough in pastry bag; squeeze 6-inch lengths of dough onto wax paper. Heat oil in large deep skillet on medium-high heat. Add half of the dough strips; cook 5 min. or until golden brown, turning occasionally. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining dough strips. Place churros on serving platter; sprinkle evenly with cinnamon sugar. Serve warm.

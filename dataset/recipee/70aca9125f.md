### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 teaspoon of sauce, peppers, hot, chili, mature red, canned

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, oregano, dried

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 12 cup of cheese, cheddar

 - 13 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Preheat oven to gas mark 7/425F/220C. Sift flour, baking powder and salt into a mixing bowl along with dried chili flakes and dried oregano. Rub in the butter and grated cheese till the mixture is crumbly. Add in cold water and mix lightly until mixture holds together and leaves side of the bowl clean. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough to a 10x10 inches square. Now cut the square in half lengthwise, then cut crosswise into strips about 1/2 inch wide. Carefully lift each strip and twist gently and place them on a baking sheet. Bake on the middle shelf of the oven for about 15 minutes, or until lightly golden browned. Remove from oven and carefully transfer cheese twists onto a wire rack to cool. Store in an air-tight container - if you have any left!

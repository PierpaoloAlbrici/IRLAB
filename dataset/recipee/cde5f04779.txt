Pumpkin Spice Muddy Buddies


Ingredients


 - 6 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt


 - 12 ounce of candies, white chocolate


 - 1 cup of sugars, powdered


 - 2 teaspoon of pumpkin, raw


 - 1 cup of baking chocolate, mars snackfood us, m&m's milk chocolate mini baking bits


Instructions: 

Pour the rice cereal into a large bowl and set aside. In a microwavable bowl, add the candy melts and melt according to package directions. Usually you heat for 20-30 second intervals, stirring in between and continuing until completely smooth and melted. Pour melted candy on top of cereal. With a wooden spoon, stir gently to coat each piece. Into a large zip-lock bag, add the powdered sugar and pumpkin pie spice. Add the coated cereal, seal the bag and shake to combine. Pour into your serving bowl and add your candy of choice. Cover and store leftover muddy buddies in an airtight container. Slightly adapted from Sallys Baking Addiction and inspired by the Chex brand original Muddy Buddies recipe.

### Ingredients

 - 3/4 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

 - 1/2 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular

 - 1/2 cup of cream, sour, cultured

 - 2 tablespoon of sauce, hot chile, sriracha

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1/2 teaspoon of celery, raw

 - 1/2 teaspoon of parsley, fresh

 - 1/2 teaspoon of dill weed, fresh

 - 1/2 teaspoon of chives, raw

### Instructions

Combine all of the ingredients in a blender and puree. Pour the mixture into the canister of a 1-pint iSi Gourmet Whip Plus siphon (see Note). Seal the siphon and charge it with one iSi cream (N20) cartridge according to the manufacturers instructions. Shake the siphon to distribute the gas and refrigerate until well chilled, 30 minutes. To serve, hold the siphon upside down and shake it. Press the lever to release the foam; if the foam is too runny, use a second charger and shake again.

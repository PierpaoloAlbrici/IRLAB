### Instructions

Sprinkle crushed coffee beans evenly over the bottom of an 8-inch square pan. Combine the butter and brown sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Stir constantly over medium-low heat for exactly 7 minutes. Immediately pour the mixture over the crushed coffee beans and quickly spread it out to the sides. Sprinkle the chocolate chips evenly over the mixture. Cover the pan with a breadboard and let it sit for 5 minutes. Spread the melted chocolate chips evenly over the toffee. Refrigerate for 1-3 hours. Turn the pan over and the mixture will fall out and can easily be broken into pieces.

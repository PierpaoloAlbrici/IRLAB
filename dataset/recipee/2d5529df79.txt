Cheddar Apple Buttermilk Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1/2 teaspoon of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 2 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of apples, raw, with skin


 - 1/2 cup of cheese, cheddar


 - 23 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. To a mixing bowl, add flour, baking powder, cream of tartar, sugar, and salt. Stir together. Using a pastry blender, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles crumbs. Stir in the apples and all but 3 tablespoons of the cheese. Add the buttermilk and stir gently to moisten until it just comes together (more buttermilk can be added by the tablespoon, if needed). Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and pat or roll the dough into 1/2 inch thickness. Cut biscuits using a biscuit cutter. Place the biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet. Top each biscuit with some of the remaining cheddar cheese. Bake 12-15 minutes. Best served hot from the oven. Adapted from Oleander and Palm.

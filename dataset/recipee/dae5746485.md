### Ingredients

 - 23 cup of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)

 - 13 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

You will need a large cooking pot. It should have a wide opening and be slightly shallow ( large, deep soup pots don't work as well.) Make sure you have a lid that fits! Place 2/3 cup popcorn inside pot. The pot will be the perfect size if the popcorn just barely covers the entire bottom of the pot in one layer. Stir in 1/3 cup oil of your choice and cover with the lid. Heat over ( MEDIUM for electric range, MED-LOW for gas ) range, giving the pot a good shake every 60 seconds or so, until you hear the first kernel pop. Carefully uncover and add the 1/4 cup white sugar, stir and re-cover with the lid. Shake the pot every 20-30 seconds until popping slows to 2-3 pops every few seconds. Remove from heat and dump into large mixing bowl. While hot and sticky, salt to taste, stirring well. Enjoy!

 - 8 ounce of cranberries, dried, sweetened

 - 14 cup of orange juice, raw

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 F. In a medium-size saucepan, add apricot jam, cranberries, orange juice, cinnamon and cloves and bring to a gentle simmer, stirring occasionally. Cook until sauce lightly thickens and cranberries begin to break apart, abou 15 to 20 minutes. Remove sauce from heat and set aside. Season rack of pork generously with salt and pepper. Place the rack of pork in a small roasting pan; standing with ribs up. Roast the pork uncovered in preheated 350 F oven for 30 minutes. Brush pork ribs with 1/2 cup of sauce. Continue to roast, uncovered for another 20 minutes. Brush again with another 1/2 cup of sauce. Continue roasting, uncovered for 30 minutes longer or until meat thermometer inserted in the center of the pork registers 160 F. Brush rack of pork with a little more sauce, then let rest for 10 minutes to allow juices to set before cutting between ribs. Serve with remaining sauce alongside pork.

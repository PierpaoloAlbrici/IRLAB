Spicy Meat Rub


Ingredients


 - 3 tablespoon of spices, thyme, dried


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, paprika


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder


Instructions: 

Mix ingredients together. Store spice mix in a glass jar in a cool, dark place for up to 4 months (begins to lose flavor after 4th month). Shake over food liberally in the last 5 minutes of cooking time. This ensures the spices have time to heat-activate but don't break down.

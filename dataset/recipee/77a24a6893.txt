Easy Rolled Fondant


Ingredients


 - 2 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 23 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 cup of shortening, vegetable, household, composite


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

Instructions: 

Combine the 2-1/2 cups sugar and the water in a saucepan on the stove. Boil the mixture until a syrup is formed. In a large bowl, combine the sugar syrup and the shortening and mix well. Add the vanilla flavoring to the sugar and shortening mix. Slowly add the confectioner's sugar, mixing continuously until a thick dough begins to form. Knead the dough by hand until stiff.

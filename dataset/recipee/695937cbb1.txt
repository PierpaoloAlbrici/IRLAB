Hoe Cakes


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 4-5 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

In a large bowl, measure the corn meal and salt. Pour the boiling water over the corn meal and stir it up. The corn meal will swell up, absorbing the water, and making a very thick mash. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. You can use as little as two tablespoons of oil per panful, but it is a little easier to use 4-5 tablespoons of oil for each panful. Use your waistline and frying skill as the final judge. Now scoop up a little of the corn meal mush (about 1/4 cup) and shape it into a patty. It will still be warm from the boiling water, so don't burn your self. Plop the patty into the hot fat and get it to frying. Make some more, unti you have a panful. When the underside is crispy brown, turn them and cook the other side. When both sides are crispy and brown, transfer them to a plate to keep warm, and start another batch.

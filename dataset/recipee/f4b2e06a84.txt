Fat Free Yogurt Bread


Ingredients


 - 34 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 14 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 3 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 18 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 2 1/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


Instructions: 

Combine yeast, 1 cup flour, and other dry ingredients. Heat water and yogurt to 120 to 130F in a small bowl. Combine dry mixture and liquid ingredients in mixing bowl. Beat 2 to 3 minutes on medium speed. Stir in enough remaining flour to make a firm dough. Knead on floured surface 5 to 7 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Use additional flour if necessary. Place dough in lightly oiled bowl and turn to grease top. Cover; let rise until dough almost doubles (about 40 minutes). Turn dough onto lightly floured surface; punch down to remove air bubbles. Roll or pat into a 14 x 7 inch rectangle. Starting with shorter side, roll up tightly, pressing dough into roll with each turn. Pinch edges and ends to seal. Place in greased 8 x 4 inch bread pan. Cover; let rise until indentation remains after touching (about 40 minutes). Bake in preheated 375F oven for 30 to 35 minutes until golden brown. Remove from pan; cool.

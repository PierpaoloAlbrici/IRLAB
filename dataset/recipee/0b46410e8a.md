[0b46410e8a](http://www.food.com/recipe/low-carb-bacon-gravy-514355)

### Ingredients

 - 12 ounce of bacon, meatless

 - 14 cup of bacon, meatless

 - 14 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 1/4 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 34 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

In a heavy fry pan cook the bacon over med-high heat until done. Remove the bacon to a plate to cool and carefully (it's hot!) remove all, but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease from the pan (reserve the extra for another use). Dice up bacon. Turn the heat under the pan to med-high and whisk the flour into the bacon grease that is in the pan. Continue to stir, allowing the roux to turn light golden brown and to froth. Turn the heat down to medium and add the cream and water to the pan while continuing to stir. The gravy will thicken as it continues to cook. Once it is as thick as you would like, return the cooked, diced bacon to the pan, stirring to incorporate in the gravy. Salt and pepper to taste. Remove from the heat and serve.

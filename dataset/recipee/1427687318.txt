Ingredients


 - 200 g of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 50 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched


 - 5 g of butter, without salt


 - 5 g of sugars, granulated


 - 5 g of salt, table


 - 10 g of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 3 g of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 110 g of tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average


 - 50 g of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, basil, dried


Instructions: 

Measure out all the ingredients. Measure the the canned tomatoes by adding just enough juice to the tomato solids to cover. Add the water to the tomato, and heat until warm to the touch if it's a cold day. Put the dry yeast in the yeast compartment of your bread machine. Put the other ingredients in the main part, and let the machine handle the dough until the end of the 1st rising. After the 1st rise has finished, deflate the dough lightly, divide and round off each portion. Place the dough balls seam side down, cover with plastic wrap and a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel, and leave to rest for 20 minutes. After the dough has rested, roll out each portion into a rectangle. Fold in the top and bottom edges. Fold in half again, form into a slug shape, and pinch the seams closed securely. Line up the dough seam side down on a paper-lined baking sheet, and leave to rise (2nd rising). Using the oven's "bread-rising" function, it takes about 25 minutes at 40C. When the 2nd rising is complet, slash the tops and mist with plenty of water. Bake in a 210C oven for 20 minutes, and the bread is done. I doubled the recipe here. This is the canned diced tomato brand I use. It has a bit of spice mixed in, so I only used 3 g of salt. Another tomato bread of mine is.

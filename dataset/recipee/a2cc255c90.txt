Almost No-Knead Bread With Olives, Rosemary, and Parmesan


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 14 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 4 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, rosemary, dried


 - 34 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 12 cup of olives, ripe, canned (small-extra large)


 - 14 cup of alcoholic beverage, beer, regular, all


 - 2 tablespoon of alcoholic beverage, beer, regular, all


 - 1 tablespoon of vinegar, distilled


Instructions: 

Whisk together flour, yeast, salt, Parmesan, and rosemary in large bowl. Add water, olives, beer, and vinegar. Using rubber spatula, fold mixture, scraping up dry flour from bottom of bowl until shaggy ball forms. (The dough will be very wet. ). Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 8 to 18 hours. Line inside of 10 inch skillet with a 12- by 18-inch sheet of parchment paper. Spray paper with nonstick cooking spray. Transfer dough to lightly floured work surface and knead 10 to 15 times. Shape dough into ball by pulling edges into middle. Transfer dough, seam-side down, to parchment-lined skillet and spray surface of dough with nonstick cooking spray. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until dough has doubled in size and does not readily spring back when poked with finger, about 2 hours. (I've also retarded the rising by placing dough in the refrigerator for up to 12 hours. ). About 30 minutes before baking, adjust oven rack to lowest position, place a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven (with lid) on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees. Lightly flour top of dough and, using razor blade or sharp knife, make one 6-inch-long, 1/2-inch-deep slit along top of dough. Carefully remove pot from oven and remove lid. Pick up dough by lifting parchment overhang and lower into pot (let any excess parchment hang over pot edge). Cover pot and place in oven. Reduce oven temperature to 425 degrees and bake covered for approximately 30 minutes. Remove lid and continue to bake until loaf is deep brown and instant-read thermometer inserted into center registers 210 degrees, 20 to 30 minutes longer. Carefully remove bread from pot; transfer to wire rack and cool to room temperature, about 2 hours.

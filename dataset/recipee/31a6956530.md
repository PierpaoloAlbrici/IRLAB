### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of salad dressing, italian dressing, commercial, regular

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, sesame, salad or cooking

 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, brown

 - 2 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

 - 2 pound of beef, flank, steak, separable lean and fat, trimmed to 0" fat, all grades, cooked, broiled

### Instructions

In a large Ziplock baggie combine salad dressing, chili oil, brown sugar, soy sauce, red pepper flakes and ginger. Lay steak between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and using a meat mallet, pound steak until it is 1/2-inch thick. With a sharp knife, slice steak on both sides making sure not to slice all the way thru the steak. You just want to make slits, slicing against the grain. Place steak into the Ziplock baggie and coat steak with the marinade. Seal the bag and place into the refrigerator to marinate overnight. Preheat your grill to medium high heat. Grill on medium high heat 5-6 minutes per side, flipping once. Served with fried rice.

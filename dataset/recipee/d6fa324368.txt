Oat Bran With Peanut Butter


Ingredients


 - 3 tablespoon of oat bran, raw


 - 34 cup of soymilk, original and vanilla, unfortified


 - 1 teaspoon of sweetener, herbal extract powder from stevia leaf


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1 teaspoon of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


Instructions: 

In a microwave safe bowl mix together the oat bran and soy milk. Microwave it for 1 minute. Stop, stir and add the cinammon and stevia. Microwave it for another 1.30 minutes, or until you achieve the desired consistency (I like mine a little more dry). Remove from the microwave, stir and put the peanut butter. Enjoy!

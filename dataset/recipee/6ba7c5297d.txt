Plain Pizza Base


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Find a deep and wide mixing bowl, [Try not to do it on a flat surface such as counter top as it takes more time and can be quite messy. I usually use a wok as i have one:)] Add in the flour. Add in yeast and just mix it lightly with the flour. Add in water. To be on the safe side, do not add all, always leave a little in the cup and add more if necessary. Mix the mixture with hand until you knead it to a dough that does not stick to your hand. Add the olive oil at this stage. You may substitute this with butter or margarine. It's to give the dough its nice golden brown colour when baked. Knead it for a minute. Add the salt. It should be 1 flat teaspoon not heap. Knead it for 2 to 5 minutes. You may also add ingredients at this stage such as rosemary, basil, cajun spice, etc and made it your unique pizza base. Divide and roll to your desired thickness and size. Dust the working surface well with flour. Cover the unused portion to avoid drying out. [If you want to save the dough, divide and roll it tight as a ball, the wrap it with clear plastic film. Keep it in the freezer. I keep them for maximum 2 weeks. Before using it, let it thaw for 30min to an hour, It might get a bit sticky as it has all those water condension. Add a bit of flour and roll your dough.] Preheat the oven to 250 degree celcius. Add your favourite ingredients and put in the oven to bake at 220 degree celcius for 10 minutes.

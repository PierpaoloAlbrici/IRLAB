Quick Food Processor Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 13 cup of butter, without salt


 - 34 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Put the flour, baking powder and salt in the food processor. Pulse several times to mix. If your shortening is hard cut it up before dropping on the food processor. Pulse until shortening is in bits about the size of small peas. Add milk and pulse until dough comes together. Dump on to a floured board and knead for a minute or two. Roll to 1/2 inch thick and cut dough with a floured biscuit cutter. Brush the biscuits with melted butter before baking on a lightly greased cookie sheet for 12-15 minutes.

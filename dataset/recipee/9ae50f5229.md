### Ingredients

 - 2 1/2 cup of orange juice, raw

 - 13 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

### Instructions

Place orange juice, honey, and 1/3 cup superfine sugar into a saucepan. Bring to a boil and simmer 10 minutes. In the meantime, use left over oranges as the serving cups. Slice the bottom slightly to allow it to stand up in the freezer. Dip the rim of each orange slice in the additional 2TBS of sugar, as if you are rimming a cocktail glass. Place Orange Cups in the freezer. Pour hot orange juice mixture into a shallow dish and freeze. Check every hour, and scrape with a fork -- my son's favorite job! After about 4 hours, it will be ready to scoop into the orange cups to serve. The granita can also be served adult-style with a little vodka in a martini glass and a sprig of fresh mint.

### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of cherries, sweet, raw

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Line a baking sheet with foil and spray with cooking spray. Add one layer of grape or cherry tomatoes, sprinkle with salt and fresh herbs if desired. Roast in a 200 F oven for about 2 hours. Watch carefully through the oven window. Try NOT to open the door as you will let out the heat and increase the cooking time. Tomatoes vary in size so the time is approximate. When they are shriveled and getting dry, remove them and allow them to cool. A little more moisture will evaporate. Return to the oven if you feel they need to cook more. Note the amount of time so that you have it for future reference. Store in a loosely sealed zip top bag in the refrigerator for a few days. Then seal tightly and store in a cool dark place for up to 6 months.

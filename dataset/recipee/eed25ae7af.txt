Buttered Pecans


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of butter, salted


 - 1 1/2 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 350F (175C). Melt the butter in a skillet. Remove from the heat and toss the pecans with the melted butter until well coated, then sprinkle with the salt. Spread evenly on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring once during baking. Remove from the oven and let cool completely. Chop the Buttered Pecans coarsely, then add them to them to 1 quart (1 liter) of ice cream in the machine during the last minute of churning, or sprinkle them over when serving ice cream. Buttered Pecans can be stored for up to 2 days in an airtight container at room temperature. If you dont have time to make your own ice cream, take a pint of your favorite store-bought premium vanilla ice cream and soften it in an electric stand mixer, using the paddle attachment. Once its softened slightly, add whatever flavorings you want. You can add mint or citrus oil (start with 1/8 teaspoon per pint, then taste and add more if desired), a favorite liqueur (1 to 2 tablespoons per pint), or any of the crunchy mix-ins in this chapter. Return the ice cream to the freezer and chill firmly before you serve it. To make instant creme anglaise, melt down some premium vanilla ice cream. Voila!

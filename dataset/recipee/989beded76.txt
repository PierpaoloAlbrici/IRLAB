Pesto Potato, Tomato & Fresh Mozzarella Salad


Ingredients


 - 2 pound of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 13 cup of sauce, pesto, classico, basil pesto, ready-to-serve


 - 6 ounce of cherries, sweet, raw


 - 3 ounce of cheese, mozzarella, low sodium


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Place the potato pieces in a large pot of cold, salted water. Bring the water to a boil and cook the potatoes until they are tender when pierced with a fork, but not falling apart. Drain the potatoes and run them under cold water to stop further cooking. Place the potatoes in a serving bowl and gently toss with pesto until well combined. Gently toss with tomatoes and mozzarella with the potatoes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve or refrigerate, covered, until ready to serve.

### Instructions

Put all the ingredients in a bread machine. Lightly drain the excess water from tofu, break into pieces and add to the bread machine. Kneading time: 15 minutes, 1st rising: 40 minutes Divide the Step 1 dough into 10 pieces, shape into balls, and cover with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out. Let them sit for 15 minutes. If the dough is sticky, flour your hands. Dust a chopstick with a small amount of flour, and press down in the middle of each roll without cutting it in half. Arrange the Step 3 dough on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 ~ 20 minutes at 200C, and they're done. You don't need to let them rise a 2nd time.

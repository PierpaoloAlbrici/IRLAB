Pooris (Fried Indian Bread)


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, canola


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Put the flour and salt into a medium-sized bowl. Pour the oil and hot water on top. Mix together with hands until it becomes a soft dough. Cover the dough with a damp towel to keep it moist. Let the dough sit for 30 minutes. Sprinkle some flour on the counter and knead the dough for a couple of minutes. Divide the dough into 6 equal parts. Roll each piece into a 6-inch circle. Be sure to cover each circle with a cloth to keep from drying out. Heat a couple of tablespoons of canola oil in a skillet. When the skillet is hot, fry one circle of dough at a time, adding a little oil with each. Fry 15-20 seconds on each side until the it is puffed and golden. Serve hot.

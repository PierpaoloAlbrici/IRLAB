Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 355 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Cream together margarine, sugars and vanilla extract with an electric mixture. Add flour and salt to creamed mixture and beat well. Mix baking soda and boiling water until baking soda dissolves. Add to creamed mixture and beat well. Add oats and chocolate chips and stir to combine. Drop dough by teaspoonfuls about 1 to 2 inches apart on cookie sheet. Bake for 810 minutes or until just beginning to brown. Be careful not to over-bake or cookies will become hard once cooled. Allow cookies to cool on cookie sheet for a couple minutes and then remove to a wire rack to cool completely. Makes about 4 dozen cookies. Recipe adapted from Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies III by Janie Mai, found on All Recipes.

Peanut Butter Granola


Ingredients


 - 4 1/2 cup of oats


 - 1 cup of wheat germ, crude


 - 1 cup of seeds, sunflower seed kernels, dried


 - 12 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 13 cup of sugars, brown


 - 3 tablespoon of apple juice, canned or bottled, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid


 - 2 tablespoon of molasses


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


 - 34 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 1 cup of raisins, seeded


 - 1 cup of nuts, almonds


Instructions: 

Position the racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven; preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Mix the oats, wheat germ, sunflower seeds, powdered nonfat dry milk, and cinnamon in a large bowl and set aside. Whisk the brown sugar, apple juice, molasses, and honey in a medium saucepan until the sugar dissolves. Whisk in the peanut butter until creamy. Pour the mixture over the dry ingredients and toss well with a wooden spoon. This takes quite a while because the mixture is a bit stiff and there's no added oil. Spread the granola onto two large, lipped baking sheets over parchment paper and bake for 20 minutes, stirring twice at seven minute intervals. Stir in the nuts and reverse the sheets top to bottom and back to front. Continue baking until dry, lightly browned, and very aromatic, about 25 more minutes, stirring often. Remove from the oven and place on wire racks for 5 minutes, and then stir 1/2 cup of raisins into the mixture on each sheet. Cool completely, about two hours. Transfer to covered bowl and store at room temperature for up to 1 month.

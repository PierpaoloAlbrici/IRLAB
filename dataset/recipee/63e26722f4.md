### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of blueberries, raw

 - 1/2 cup of spices, basil, dried

 - 4 cup of spices, basil, dried

### Instructions

Combine crushed fresh blueberries and 1/2 c. torn basil in a large, sterilized wide-mouthed jar, and set aside. Place vinegar in a medium nonaluminum saucepan, and bring to a boil. Pour warm vinegar over blueberry mix; cover jar, and let stand at room temperature for 2 weeks. Yield: 4 c. (serving size: 1 Tbsp. ). NOTES : This is a great start for most any salad dressing and makes a perfect hostess gift. Strain vinegar through several layers of cheesecloth into decorative jars; throw away blueberry pulp. Add in additional basil leaves to jars, if you like. Seal jars with a cork or possibly other airtight lid.

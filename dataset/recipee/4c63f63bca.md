[4c63f63bca](http://www.food.com/recipe/low-cal-vegan-applesauce-pancakes-for-one-or-two-461622)

### Ingredients

 - 13 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 23 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 14 cup of applesauce, canned, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid (includes usda commodity)

 - 14 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Mix all ingredients together in a medium sized bowl until smooth. Let it sit for a couple of minutes (literally, maybe 2 minutes). Heat a non-stick skillet/pan to medium heat. Cook mixture as you would normal pancakes, flipping over to the other side once bubbles appear. Serve with yummy toppings! I like to use Greek yogurt + fruit puree with some chocolate chips.

## Whipped Dairy-Free Butter

[11875617a0](http://www.food.com/recipe/whipped-dairy-free-butter-516966)

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

 - 1 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Combine ingredients in a small saucepan over low heat. Gently heat, whisking until oils are mixed and salt is melted. Pour mixture into the bowl of your stand mixer and place the bowl in the fridge. Cool the mixture until it just begins to harden, about 30 minutes. (DO NOT let it harden all the way or you won't be able to whip it.) It's ready to whip when it turns solid in color, rather than translucent. If you get impatient, you can freeze the bowl for NO LONGER THAN 2-3 minutes. With your stand mixer on low speed, mix to break up clumps, about 30 seconds. Turn to high speed (about an 8 on my Kitchenaid) and mix until the mixture doubles in volume, about 1-2 minutes. Scoop into molds (I use ice cube trays) or just throw it into a container and keep in the fridge. If left on the counter, the mixture will not stay whipped.

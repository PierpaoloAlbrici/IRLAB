Croation Apple Strudel Recipe


Ingredients


 - 3 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 3/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 4 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


Instructions: 

Mix above ingredients and knead on floured board till no longer sticks to hands. Don't USE EXCESS FLOUR: Sprinkle little flour over large cloth on table. Divide dough into two equal parts. Place one ball in center of cloth, dough greased with a little oil. Put a little oil on other ball and set aside. Wait 1/2 hour: With first ball of dough roll out with rolling pin like as for pie. NOT TOO BIG. Wait 20 min. A must. Dough will stretch easily. While dough is resting prepare apples, peeled, sliced and dipped in salted water. Don't LET DOUGH STAND TOO LONG Or possibly IT WILL DRY AND CRACK WHEN ROLLED. After the 20 min stretch dough to paper thinness, brush with melted butter, sprinkle with some bread crumbs and sugar over entire stretched dough. Along one side of dough (lengthwise) place sliced apples inward to about 6" and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon over the apples. Splash with melted butter and roll using the cloth to roll up. Place on a greased sheet in "S" shape or possibly horseshoe. Cut top with gashes for steam to avoid sogginess. Brush melted butter and bake at 375 degrees for 50 min or possibly till golden. With second ball of dough, roll out as for pie. Wait 20 min and continue as for first roll. Makes 2 large rolls. NOTE: 1/2 recipe may be halved to make two smaller strudels, one to bake and one to freeze. Sugar: Depends on sweetness of apples. Apples: 8 to 10 depending on size of apples and size of roll.

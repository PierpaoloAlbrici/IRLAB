### Ingredients

 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 pound of asparagus, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 13 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard

### Instructions

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the butter and olive oil until the butter is melted. Add asparagus to the skillet. Using a spatula, flip and stir to coat each asparagus with butter/olive oil. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. To the skillet, add lemon juice, salt, lemon pepper, and half of the Parmesan. Cover and let cook for 3-5 more minutes, or until asparagus is tender. Flip and turn asparagus one or two times throughout cook time. Once cooked, flip and turn asparagus one last time to evenly coat. Sprinkle tops of asparagus with remaining Parmesan cheese. Serve warm.

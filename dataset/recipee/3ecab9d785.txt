Slice pork into 3" x 1/4" shreds. Combine marinade ingredients in a small bowl. Add pork shreds, mix well. Let stand 30 minutes. Combine ingredients for Sweet Bean Sauce in another bowl; set aside. Arrange green onion shreds in a layer on a platter. Heat oil in a wok over medium heat. Carefully lower pork shreds into hot oil with a slotted metal spoon. Stir-fry for about 2 minutes until pork shreds are no longer pink. Remove pork from oil with slotted spoon, draining well over wok, set aside. Remove oil from wok except 3 tablespoons. Add Sweet Bean Sauce to oil. Stir-fry until sauce thickens slightly. Add cooked pork mixing well. Place pork and Sweet Bean Sauce on top of green onions. Serve immediately. *Shredding: is similar to julienne technique. Cut the food into long strips about 2 inches wide and then chop it into matchsticks.

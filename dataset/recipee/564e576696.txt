" Child's Play" Sour Pops


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of lime juice, raw


 - 3 cup of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

Fill as many ice trays as needed with lemon and lime juice (I ended up using 6 trays). Cover trays in plastic wrap and poke toothpicks through into each slot, actually the toothpick thing is optional, you could just use them to spice up a drink and make them ice cubes. I personally find the toothpick thing too messy! Pop trays into freezer and be sure to check them periodically, but no sticking your fingers through the plastic to get a taste, okay? ha ha.

### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 cup of wild rice, raw

 - 14 cup of orange juice, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of vinegar, cider

 - 2 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

 - 2 teaspoon of honey

 - 1 teaspoon of oil, sesame, salad or cooking

 - 1 cup of cranberries, dried, sweetened

 - 12 cup of onions, spring or scallions (includes tops and bulb), raw

 - 3 ounce of peaches, yellow, raw

 - 14 cup of nuts, pecans

### Instructions

Bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add the rice blend and return to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Spread the rice on a baking sheet and let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the orange juice, vinegar, soy sauce, honey and sesame oil in a large bowl, beating with a whisk until blended. Stir in the rice and the remaining ingredients; toss well to coat. Serve at once or cover and let stand at room temperature up to 2 hours.

Just 10 Minutes! Easy, Authentic, Chewy and Fluffy Pizza


Ingredients


 - 200 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 140 ml of water, bottled, generic


 - 3 g of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Combine the flour, salt, sugar, and dry yeast in a bowl and lightly mix. If using fresh yeast, soak in lukewarm water. Add the lukewarm water (with the fresh yeast if using fresh yeast) and mix with your hands. You can also use a rubber spatula if you like. Bring it all together and knead in the center of the bowl or on a lightly dusted table or board. After about 5 minutes, it should not be sticky. It is ready when it's elastic. If it's rather sticky, add a bit of flour. Cover the bowl with a moistened and wrung out towel, cover with a plastic bag or plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 5~8 hours for the second rising. If you're in a hurry, chill for 2 hours. The dough should rise to about twice the size. The picture shows dough that has chilled for 5 hours. Coat your finger with flour and try pressing a hole into it. Divide into 2 equal pieces and roll into balls. Cover so that it doesn't dry out and let rest for 20 minutes. Preheat your oven to the highest temperature possible, heating your baking pan at the same time. I use a convection oven that goes up to 250C. Flatten the rested dough out on kitchen parchment paper. Press out to 30 cm diameter and top with the toppings. It will become a bit springier and puffier than your ear. Slide the pizza with the kitchen parchment paper onto the hot baking pan from the preheated oven. It'll puff right up. It'll be done in 10 minutes. The pictured pizza is topped with tomato sauce, sliced mozzarella, and dried basil.

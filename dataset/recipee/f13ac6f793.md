### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 14 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of sugars, brown

 - 2 cup of oats

 - 12 ounce of candies, caramels

 - 34 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

### Instructions

Pre heat oven to 350 degrees. Mix the 1st 6 ingredients together in mixer until crumbly -- Grandma says mix like pie crust. Pat all but approximately 1 1/2 cups of batter into a 9 X 13 cake pan. Bake for 10 minutes. While this is baking, melt the caramels with the 3/4 cup whipping cream. A double boiler is recommended, but you could use the microwave if you stop and stir often to make sure the caramels do not burn. Spread caramel mix over the 1st layer when it has baked. Use the remaining 1 1/2 cups of batter and pat down in small sections over the caramel mix. Return to oven and bake for about 15 minutes or longer -- til they are done. Remove from oven and cool. Enjoy! *Pointer-Can use Caramel bites that are now available in the baking aisle at the grocery store rather than having to unwrap all the caramels. Also, Grandma says that 1/2 and 1/2 could be used rather than cream if you would like.

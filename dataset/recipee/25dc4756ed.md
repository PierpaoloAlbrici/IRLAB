### Ingredients

 - 1 2/3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 34 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 12 teaspoon of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

In a mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients; transfer mixture to a plastic zip-top bag or air-tight glass jar. Include the following instructions: in a mixing bowl, beat 1 large egg and 1 cup milk; add in funnel cake mix and beat until smooth. In a frying pan, heat oil (1-inch depth) until 375 degrees. Pour batter, 1/2 cup at a time through a funnel into the hot oil with a circular motion to form a spiral. Fry until golden; turn to fry the other side. Remove funnel cake to drain on paper towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining batter. Sprinkle with powdered sugar while warm. Note: takes a little practice to get the hang of it.

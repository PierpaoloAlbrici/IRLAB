Kath's Cinnamon Honey Butter


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of sugars, powdered


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 12 cup of honey


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


Instructions: 

Simply put everything into a bowl and mix using the electric mixer until the spread is thoroughly incorporated. Empty into a Tupperware container or an old margarine type container with a lid and store in the fridge. I usually take the honey butter out of the fridge about 10 minutes before I spread it on my toast so it spreads easily. Sooo YUMMY! :). Note: I usually double this recipe because it doesn't last long enough in my house but you might want to go by the amounts used above first to see if it is something you will like.

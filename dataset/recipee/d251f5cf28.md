### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of sugars, brown

 - 13 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 3/4 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Line a 9-inch pie pan with rolled out dough, prick all over with a fork, then press a piece of heavy-duty foil snugly into the pie shell. Bake for about 6 minutes, remove the foil and bake about 4 minutes more until just beginning to brown. Remove from oven and reduce heat to 350 degrees. Sift the sugar, flour and salt into a bowl, and stir with a fork; mix well. Pour the sugar mixture into the pie shell and spread evenly over the bottom. Pour cream over the sugar mixture, completely covering. Dab the softened butter in bits over the cream. Sprinkle the nutmeg evenly over the top. Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes or until golden spots form on top. This may take as long as an hour. The filling will seem liquid but will become more firm as it cools.

### Ingredients

 - 1 1/8 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 23 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 18 cup of bacon, meatless

### Instructions

Blend above ingredients in a mixing bowl. Dump a hand full of flour on a pastry cloth or whatever. A brown paper sack also works. Newspaper also works just fine. Dump the blended dough onto the flour. Pour a dash of oil into your skillet and smear it around with your fingers. Coat the inside of the skillet and the palms of your hands with oil. Knead the dough for about 30 seconds, rolling it in the flour and thickening it. Halve the dough. Halve it again, making 4 pieces of dough. Roll each piece of dough between your hands, making it into a ball, then put it in the skillet. Use a spoon or a pastry brush and put a little oil or bacon drippings on the top of each unbaked biscuit. Preheat oven to 350. Bake 25 minutes. Broil/toast for 1 or 2 minutes.

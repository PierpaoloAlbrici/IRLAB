### Ingredients

 - 6 ounce of orange juice, raw

 - 1/4 cup of vinegar, red wine

 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, brown

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

 - 2 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 2 teaspoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

### Instructions

1. Combine all of the ingredients in a small saucepan and stir over low heat until blended. 2. You can use the sauce as a marinade or for basting. Just remember that you should reserve a portion for the basting and dont re-use marinade once youve had raw meat in it. 3. Sauce will keep in the fridge for about a week. I didnt re-heat it before basting it on the meat so its fine to use it right out of the fridge.

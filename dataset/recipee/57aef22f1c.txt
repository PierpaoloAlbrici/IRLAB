Spicy Pickled Beets


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of beets, raw


 - 12 cup of vinegar, distilled


 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cloves, ground


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Place beets in a sterilized jar. Combine vinegar, water, brown sugar, cloves, cinnamon and salt in a saucepan, bring to a boil. Pour over sliced beets, cover tightly, refrigerate for 8 hours or longer until beets are pickled. (Remove cloves after 3 days.) Store in refrigerator up to 2 months. Variation: These are best with fresh beets, but if fresh beets are unavailable, well drained canned beets will work nearly as well.

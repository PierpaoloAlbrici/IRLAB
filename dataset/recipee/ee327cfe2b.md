### Ingredients

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

 - 13 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 tablespoon of vinegar, distilled

### Instructions

Sprinkle yeast over warm water. In a mixer or bread machine (on dough setting), combine flour and salt on low with paddle attachment. Drizzle in olive oil and vinegar until combined with flour. Pour in yeast/water mixture and allow to mix until completely blended. Coat two 1-gallon size Ziploc bags with a small amount of olive oil. Divide dough in half, deposit each half into the coated bags. Leave bag upright and slightly opened until dough doubles. Seal Ziploc bags. Drop them in the bottom of your refrigerator and forget about them until you need them. About an hour before you need the dough, take it out of the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature.

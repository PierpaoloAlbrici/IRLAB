 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 5 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 2 tablespoon of vinegar, balsamic

 - 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

In an electric coffee/spice grinder finely grind star anise. In a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan bring anise, sugar, butter, and vinegar to a boil over moderate heat, stirring, and boil 1 minute. Remove pan from heat and stir in flour and a pinch salt until mixture is smooth. Cool dough to room temperature. Form and bake cookies as directed at below. Preheat oven to 350F and line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Roll level 1/2-teaspoons dough into balls and arrange 4 inches apart on baking sheets. Bake cookies in batches in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching position of sheets halfway through baking, 10 minutes, or until cookies are flat and golden. Transfer parchment with cookies to racks to cool. Cool baking sheets and line with fresh parchment between batches.

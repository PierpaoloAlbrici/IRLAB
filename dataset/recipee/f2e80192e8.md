[f2e80192e8](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/basic-pizza-dough-recipe.html)

### Ingredients

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 1/4 ounce of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 3 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 3 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Whisk 1 1/3 cups warm water (105 degrees F) and the sugar in a bowl; sprinkle the yeast on top. Set aside until foamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in the olive oil. Whisk the flour and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture. Gradually stir with a wooden spoon to make a rough dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes, dusting with more flour if necessary. Form into 2 balls. Brush 2 large bowls with olive oil, add a ball of dough to each and turn to coat with the oil. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour, 30 minutes. Roll out and top as desired, or wrap in plastic wrap and freeze up to 1 month.

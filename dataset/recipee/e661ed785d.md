### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 pound of sugars, granulated

 - 3 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400F. Spread the almonds on a baking sheet; place in the oven. Toast until the almonds are golden and fragrant, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven; let cool completely. Transfer half the almonds to a cutting board, and chop coarsely. Place the remaining half in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade; process until the almonds are finely chopped, 15 to 20 seconds. Add the coarsely chopped almonds, and stir to combine. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the peas, lemon juice, salt, and pepper; stir until all the ingredients are well combined and heated through, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with the almonds, and toss to coat. Transfer to a serving bowl, and serve.

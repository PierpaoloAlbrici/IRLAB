Irish Style Potato-Chive Pancakes


Ingredients


 - 2 pound of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 13 cup of chives, raw


 - 34 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 3 teaspoon of butter, without salt


 - 12 cup of cream, sour, cultured


Instructions: 

Place potatoes in large saucepan; cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat; simmer uncovered until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain potatoes, then return to saucepan. Turn heat under saucepan to medium-low. Cook potatoes until dry, about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add milk. Using a potato masher, mash potato mixture until fairly smooth. Remove from heat; stir in chives, salt and pepper. Transfer to a medium bowl, cover and refrigerate until cold. Potatoes will thicken as they cool. Form potato mixture into 12 patties about 3 1/2 inches in diameter and 1/2 inch thick. Melt 1 teaspoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot and sizzling. Add three or four patties to skillet. Cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Keep warm in a 200 degrees F oven while cooking remaining patties in remaining butter. Serve warm with sour cream.

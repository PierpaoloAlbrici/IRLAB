[97c8102568](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/special-dietary-needs/gluten-free/oatalmond-meal-pie-crust/)

### Ingredients

 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 2 tablespoon of syrup, maple, canadian

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of nuts, almonds

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a pie dish with parchment paper with opposing sides exposed (your handles so you can take the pie out of the dish)I just put a straight sheet of parchment paper in there. Mix the butter, maple syrup and sea salt in a large bowl with a fork. If your butter is still cold, just work the fork into it more. Add 1/4 of the oat flour and stir and mash. Add the rest slowly while stirring and mashing (this will help the butter even out easily). Next, add the almond meal and stir and mash. Use your hand to ensure that butter is worked into the dough evenly. Press the dough in to the prepared pie dish. Bake at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes if you are going to bake a pie, or 15 minutes if you are going to fill the crust with a no-bake filling. Let cool completely before filling the pie.

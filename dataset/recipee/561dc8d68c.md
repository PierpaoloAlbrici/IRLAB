### Ingredients

 - 1 1/3 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 2 pound of sugars, brown

 - 1/4 cup of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt

 - 1 1/2 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

### Instructions

In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine milk and sugar. Heat to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface. Remove from the heat and stir in margarine, peanut butter and vanilla. Quickly spread into a 9x13 inch dish. Allow to cool almost completely before cutting into squares. Store in an airtight container.

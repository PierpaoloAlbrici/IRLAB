### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 4 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

### Instructions

Place almonds and enough water to cover by 1-inch in a medium sized bowl; cover and let it sit overnight. Drain and rinse almonds well in a colander. Blend almonds and 4 cups water on high in a powerful blender (I used my Vitamix) until well-processed, about 1 minute. Pieces of fiber will remain throughout. Strain almond-mixture through a nut-milk bag or cheesecloth into a separate bowl or container, squeezing to extract as much juice as possible. Return almond milk to blender and add honey and vanilla. Blend on low to combine for about 30 seconds. Store in refrigerator. Best used within 4 days.

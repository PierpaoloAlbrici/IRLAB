### Ingredients

 - 6 ounce of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 cup of cherries, sweet, raw

 - 2 teaspoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

Whisk together flour, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Cut in cold butter with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the flour mixture and pour in water and vodka, if using. Toss with a fork until flour mixture is moistened, then use your hands to bring dough together into a ball. Flatten into a disc, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Roll dough into a large disk about 13 inches wide and 1/8-inch thick. Transfer dough to the prepared baking sheet. Pour cherry filling into the middle of the dough, leaving a 3-inch border. Fold the outside edge of the dough over the fruit, making occasional pleats. Brush milk over dough; generously sprinkle with sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden and the fruit is bubbling, 35 minutes.

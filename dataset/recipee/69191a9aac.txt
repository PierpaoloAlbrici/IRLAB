Pork Roast


Ingredients


 - 3 1/2 pound of pork, fresh, loin, tenderloin, separable lean only, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 dash of salt, table


 - 1 dash of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 dash of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


Instructions: 

Rub roast with olive oil then season with salt, pepper and cayenne. Place fat side up and roast at 400 degrees for one hour then reduce oven to 325 degrees and bake for three hours. Note: I usually do this in a large roasting pan that has a rack so the juices drip off the pork. It might work just fine in a regular roasting pan but Im still a novice so Im not exactly sure.

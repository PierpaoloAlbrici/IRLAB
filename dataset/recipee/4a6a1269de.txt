Creamy Vanilla Frosting


Ingredients


 - 1 1/3 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 14 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 1/3 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 1/3 cup of butter, without salt


 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Combine milk, flour, salt in a saucepan with the heat turned off. Whisk until smooth. Cook over medium high heat, whisking until mixture thickens and comes to a boil (about 5-7 minutes). Yes! I use measuring cup on a stove top :). Boil for 1 minute, remove from heat then strain into a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap to avoid skin from forming. Cool for about an hour and half. When flour mixture is cool, beat butter, sugar and vanilla in a large bowl until light and creamy. Adding a dollop at a time, beat in the cooled flour mixture until the frosting is creamy and light. Enough frosting for 24 cupcakes. Tip: Add 2 tablespoons (30ml) unflavored gelatin in the frosting to help stablize the cream. (In 50ml hot water add 1 gram of unflavoured gelatin or depending on the packet instruction.

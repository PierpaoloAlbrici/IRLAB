Scottish Shortbread


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 1/2 cup of rice flour, white, unenriched


 - 12 cup of sugars, powdered


Instructions: 

Sieve flour and rice flour. Add the sugar and butter and mix together until the mixture resembles the texture of shortcrust pastry. Shape into a square cake and divide into"fingers" (bars/strips). Pinch the edges (flute) and prick all over with a fork. Place on greased or parchment lined sheet. Bake in a preheated 325F oven, until beginning to colour (about 10-15 minutes), then lower the heat to about 275 to 300F (depending on your oven) and bake for about 45-60 minutes more. Carefully remove from sheet and cool on rack.

Anna Olson's Crisp Fruit Chips


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of pineapple, raw, all varieties


 - 12 cup of sugars, powdered


Instructions: 

Using a mandolin slicer (inexpensive Japanese versions are available in most kitchen supply stores), very thinly slice your favourite fruits. Arrange slices in a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet; sprinkle with icing sugar. Top with another sheet of parchment and another baking sheet. Dry in a 225 degrees F (110 degrees C) oven for 45 minutes. Remove top baking sheet and top layer of parchment; continue drying in the oven for at least another 45 minutes, until crisp. The more moist the fruit the longer it will take to dry. Let cool completely; store in an airtight container.

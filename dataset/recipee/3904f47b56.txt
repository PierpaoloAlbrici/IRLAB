Fruit Filling


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of cherries, sweet, raw


 - 3/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of cornstarch


Instructions: 

If using diced apples or pears, poach them in boiling water for 1 minute, then drain. Whisk the water, sugar, salt, and cornstarch together in a saucepan to make a slurry, then bring it to a boil over a medium heat, stirring constantly. It should thicken by the time it comes to a boil. Remove it from the heat immediately, then stir in the fruit. Some fruits will leach moisture into the slurry, so stir the filling a few times as it cools.

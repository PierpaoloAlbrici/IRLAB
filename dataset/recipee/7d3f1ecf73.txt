Lemon Glaze


Ingredients


 - 1/4 cup of lemon juice, raw


 - 1 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Combine the lemon juice and sugar in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring, for 10 to 15 minutes, until transparent. Test to see if the syrup forms a "string" when dropped from a spoon. When it does, take it off the heat and spoon it over the slightly cooled pecan harvest loaf.

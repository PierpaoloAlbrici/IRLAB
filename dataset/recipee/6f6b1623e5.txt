Sour-Cherry Crumble


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of cherries, sweet, raw


 - 4 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 13 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1/4 cup of nuts, walnuts, english


 - 1/4 cup of oats


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Combine the cherries and the sugar and let stand for 10 minutes. Place in a sieve and let drain very well. Place in a 9-inch pie plate and set aside. In a medium-size bowl, combine the all-purpose and whole-wheat flours, sugar, salt and cinnamon. Rub in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the walnuts and oats and toss lightly to combine. Cover the cherries with the topping and bake until the topping is crisp and the juices are bubbling, about 40 minutes. Place on a rack to cool slightly before servings.

Divine Chocolate Truffles


Ingredients


 - 100 g of martha white foods, martha white's buttermilk biscuit mix, dry


 - 175 g of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 50 g of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Crush the digestive biscuits into crumbs (Putting it into a small plastic bag and hitting it with a rolling pin works best). Break the chocolate into small pieces and put into a microwaveable bowl. Put the bowl into a saucepan about halfway full of water depending how big the bowl is (The bowl and water shouldn't touch each other) and heat until melted. Mix in the butter and crushed biscuits. Leave mixture in the fridge for 10 minutes. Take a teaspoonful of the mixture and roll it into a ball shape with your hands. To make it look more truffley roll it in cocoa powder or chocolate sprinkles. Enjoy!

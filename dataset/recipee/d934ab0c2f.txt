Berry Crumble Bake


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 12 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 cup of sugars, brown


 - 2 cup of blueberries, raw


Instructions: 

Mix everything but the berries together. Put 2/3 of the batter into your bakingtray, slightly pulling upp at the edges. Pour blueberries into the tray and decorate with the rest of the batter (you can flatten it out and make lines to put in crosses over the berries, i like cutting out flowers or hearts or just crumble it over). Bake at 200C for 20 minutes or until golden. Enjoy not completely cooled off with vanila icecream or whipped cream (or both).

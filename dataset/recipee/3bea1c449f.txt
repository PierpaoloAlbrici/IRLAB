Tofu Ricotta


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of tofu, raw, regular, prepared with calcium sulfate


 - 3 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 2 teaspoon of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, basil, dried

Instructions: 

Break the tofu into large chunks. Place in a sauce pan and cover with water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, simmer for 5 minutes. Drain well. Chill covered in the fridge until cool enough to handle. Crumble and place in a bowl with remaining ingredients. Remember leave out the herbs if you want this to be sweet. Mash and blend until mixture has a fine grainy texture, similar to ricotta or cottage cheese. Chill several more hours or over night before serving. This will store for 5 days in the fridge.

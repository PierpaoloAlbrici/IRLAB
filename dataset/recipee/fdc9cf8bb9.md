### Ingredients

 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1/4 cup of honey

 - 1/4 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 3/4 cup of oats

 - 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/4 cup of nuts, pecans

 - 1/4 cup of cranberries, dried, sweetened

 - 1/4 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

### Instructions

Preheat your oven to 350 . In a bowl (I use a stand mixer), beat together the Earth Balance, honey or agave (see tip below), sugar and vanilla. In another bowl, whisk together the flour, oats, baking soda, and salt. Stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture. Add the chocolate chips, if youre using them, as well as most of the cranberries and pecans. Reserve some of the cranberries and pecans for the the tops of the cookies. Roll the dough into golf-ball-sized balls and flatten slightly. Decorate with remaining pecans and cranberries. Bake for 11 minutes. The longer you bake them, the harder/crisper they will be, so time them. Tip: if you spray your measuring cup with a little oil before you measure the honey/agave, it will slide right out.

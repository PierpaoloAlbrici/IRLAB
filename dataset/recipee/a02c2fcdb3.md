### Ingredients

 - 2 quart of beets, raw

### Instructions

Cook the beets and chop all veggies fine. Mix all ingredients together and put in STERILE jars and seal. You can put in a hot water bath for 20 minutes to seal. NOTE: You do not have to cook this as the beets are already cooked; everything will meld together and it will be yummy.

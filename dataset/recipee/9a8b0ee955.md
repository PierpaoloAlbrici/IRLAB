### Ingredients

 - 1/4 pound of pork sausage, link/patty, unprepared

 - 1 cup of onions, raw

 - 1/2 cup of peppers, sweet, green, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 2 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

 - 4 cup of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry

 - 3/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, saffron

 - 1 cup of peas, green, frozen, unprepared

### Instructions

In a large saucepan, cook the sausage over medium-high heat until browned and the fat is rendered. Add the onions and bell peppers, and cook, stirring, until very soft, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add the rice and cook, stirring, until opaque, about 1 minute. Add the stock, salt, and saffron, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until almost all the water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Add the peas without stirring, re-cover and cook until all the water is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let sit for 10 minutes before fluffing with a fork.

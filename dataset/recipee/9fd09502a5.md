[9fd09502a5](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/sidedishes/no-fail-white-rice-brown-rice-and-mexican-rice/)

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

### Instructions

Put the water into a pot with a tight fitting lid and bring to a boil over high heat. Add salt. When the water is at a full roiling boil, add the rice. Stir and return to a boil. When boiling again, reduce heat to lowest possible. Put the lid on and let sit for 15 to 20 minutes. Do not look! After 15 to 20 minutes, remove the lid, fluff and serve. Its that easy! Note: You can also use stock for your liquid instead of water. Try replacing all or even just half for a flavor boost. BROWN RICE: Same measurements, obviously substituting the white rice for brown rice. Let sit for 45 minutes though. MEXICAN RICE: Substitute 1 cup tomato sauce for 1 cup of water. While rice is cooking, saute 1/4 cup finely chopped onion in some butter. Add to rice when fluffing. You can also add a bit of cumin. Be creative; if you like green chilies, add those in, too. Or peppers. Or chopped tomatoes.

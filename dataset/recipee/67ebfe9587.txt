Berner Rosti - Rosti With Bacon


Ingredients


 - 2 pound of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 50 g of bacon, meatless


 - 1 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Peel potatoes, grate or cut into thin strips and mix with the salt. Heat the butter and lard (or oil) in a frying pan. Add the diced bacon and potato and fry gently, stirring gently and frequently. If you want a slimmer version, you can pre-cook the bacon and this way omit the bacon fat. Bring together into a cake and cover with an upside-down plate. Fry over gentle heat for 20 minutes. Pour the milk over the top and fry, covered, for about another 10 minutes. Tip out onto the plate and serve.

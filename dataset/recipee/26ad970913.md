[26ad970913](http://www.food.com/recipe/coconut-peanut-sauce-270125)

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 12 cup of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

 - 2 tablespoon of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

 - 2 teaspoon of oil, sesame, salad or cooking

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cumin seed

### Instructions

Mix all ingredients. I usually break up the peanut butter with a fork a little bit before using a whisk because if I use the whisk from the beginning the peanut butter sticks to it. Use as a sauce for a noodle dish or stir fry.

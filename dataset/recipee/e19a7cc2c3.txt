Making a Bulgarian/ Greek Style Yogurt


Ingredients


 - 1 gallon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 12 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


Instructions: 

Using a large pot, heat the milk to about 195-200 F (~91- 94 C). This is for two reasons:. One: It kills any other bacteria that might be in the milk that would compete against the bacteria that convert milk to yogurt. Two: It changes the milk protein in a way that allows it to culture and firm up. Let it cool down to 110-115F (43-46C). Wisk in the yogurt culture into the milk gently. Transfer into the yogurt jars and close the lids. Wrap jars in a thick blanket or put in a ice cooler isolated with a blanket over night. After 6-8 hours the yogurt should be firm. Test by gently turning it to see if it keeps its shape. Transfer jars to the refrigerator.

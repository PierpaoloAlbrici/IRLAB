### Ingredients

 - 6 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1 cup of shortening, vegetable, household, composite

 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Place the three dry ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Add the shortening and mix thoroughly. You can use your hands, a strong spoon, a pastry cutter or two knives. Pour in the warm water and mix well. Towards the end of mixing you will need to finish mixing with your hands. Roll the dough into a ball and knead for 6-7 minutes. Place back into the bowl and cover with waxed paper or plastic wrap. Let the dough sit for 15 -- 30 minutes. Divide the dough into approximately 32 small balls. Lightly flour your surface and roll out each ball to a 6 - 8 inch diameter tortilla. Cook on a griddle, comal, cast iron skillet, etc., on low heat or as desired. (Less chance of burning). Cook on one side until the top starts to bubble, then turn over for a few more seconds. Cooking the tortillas is similar to that of pancakes. Then enjoy!

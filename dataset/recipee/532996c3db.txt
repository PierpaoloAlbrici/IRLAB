King Arthur's Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread


Ingredients


 - 13 ounce of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 12 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 3 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


Instructions: 

Combine all ingredients and mix and knead, by hand, mixer or bread machine until you've made a smooth, fairly stiff (but not dry) dough. Place in a lightly greased bowl, covered and allow to rise for 60 to 90 minutes, until its expanded a bit. It won't have doubled in size, but should feel puffy when you squeeze it. Lightly grease a 9x5 loaf pan. Gently shape the dough into a smooth log, there's no need to punch it down, just stretch and round it to fit in the pan. Place it in the pan, smooth side up, cover the pan and allow it to rise for about 30-45 minutes, till it crowns over the rim by an inch or so. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 375F. Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes, until the center registers 190F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove it from the oven, and turn out of the pan onto a rack. Allow the bread to cool completely before slicing.

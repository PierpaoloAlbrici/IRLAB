### Ingredients

 - 34 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 3 tablespoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

### Instructions

Start a large pot of water to boiling. Stir together the flour with 1/2 cup coconut milk until dissolved. Cook over medium low heat, stirring constantly, until it forms a thick dough that pulls away from the side of the pan and is no longer sticky. Turn dough out onto a large cutting board and as soon as it is cool enough to handle knead it for several minutes to form a homogenous ball. Using a press or your fingers and a fork shape small dumplings, keeping the dough that you aren't working with covered with a damp towel. After you have formed all of the dumplings, cook in boiling water until brightly colored and cooked through, then immediately drain. While the dumplings are cooking, combine the coconut milk, sugar, and salt in a large saucepan and bring to a simmer. Add the cooked dumplings into the simmering coconut sugar mixture and simmer for a few minutes. Serve warm in bowls, and sprinkle with sesame seeds.

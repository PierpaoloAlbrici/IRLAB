If using xanthan gum, you'll neet a blender to combine water, lemon juice, sugar, salt, and hazelnut oil. Process on medium low and slowly drizzle in the xanthan gum and blend until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute. If using gelatin, allow to "bloom" in ice water. Combine water, lemon juice, sugar, salt, and hazelnut oil in a small saucepan, and gently warm to a light simmer; add the gelatin and whisk until dissolved. Strain the vinaigrette through a chinois, cover, and chill until serving. Garnish with chives.

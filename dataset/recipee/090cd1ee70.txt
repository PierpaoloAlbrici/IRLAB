Apple Thyme Jelly Recipe


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of apples, raw, with skin


 - 3 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, thyme, dried


 - 3 ounce of pectin, unsweetened, dry mix


Instructions: 

Combine the cider, sugar and thyme in a 4-qt microwave-safe bowl, and stir well. Cook, uncovered, at full power (650 to 700 watts) for 10 min. Stir, return to the microwave, and cook till the sugar has dissolved and the mix has reached a full rolling boil, about 5 more min. Stir the pectin into the mix, return it to the microwave, and cook for 1 1/2 min. Skim any foam off the surface, and pack the jelly into sterilized jars according to the manufacturer's directions. This recipe yields 4 half-pints. Comments: A delicate flavor - just perfect for glazing a simple lamb or possibly pork roast. Yield: 4 half-pints

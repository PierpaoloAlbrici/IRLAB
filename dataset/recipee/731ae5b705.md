### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of fish, cod, atlantic, raw

 - 12 cup of potatoes, raw, skin

 - 1 dash of spices, garlic powder

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F. Puree fish and potato in food processor until it forms a play dough consistency. Spread evenly into ungreased cake pan. Bake for 20 minutes until fish is springy to the touch. Here is the tricky part:. Turn fish onto cooling rack I then put the cooling rack into a sided cookie sheet. Place another cookie sheet on top and then weigh it down (I use a cast iron pot) this will squeeze out the moisture and make it a semi moist treat. Put this stack back into the oven for about 15 minutes. Carefully pull everything out and let it cool all stack up When cool, you can cut into bite-sized pieces. Store in the fridge lasts about 1-2 weeks can be frozen for up to 2 months.

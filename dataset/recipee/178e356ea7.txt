Spiced Sweet Potato Latkes


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of sweet potato, raw, unprepared


 - 1 cup of onions, raw


 - 3 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 395 degrees F, approximately 200 degrees Celsius. Mix the sweet potatoes, onion, spices, and flour together in a large bowl with a fork. Blend in the eggs and mix thoroughly. Heat 3 TBS oil in a skillet over medium heat. When the skillet is hot and oil begins to shimmer, begin cooking latkes. Measure a heaped tablespoon of the sweet potato mixture and spoon into hot skillet. Place four pancakes into the skillet per batch, flattening each with a fork. Brown latkes for about four minutes per side, until golden brown, and place on paper towel to drain oil. Keep cooked latkes in warmed oven until ready. Serve warm.

## Spiced Icing

### Ingredients

 - 13 cup of alcoholic beverage, distilled, rum, 80 proof

 - 2 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

### Instructions

In medium-sized bowl, mash butter with a fork until it's soft. Add 1 cup powered sugar and mix with fork until there's no dry sugar left. Add the rum and beat with electric mixer on medium until mixture is somewhat smooth. Slowly add in the rest of the sugar, adding more or less depending on the consistancy you'd like. Beat with mixer until completely smooth. This makes enough frosting for a batch of brownies (um, or a snack -- ), but I'm positive it could be doubled or tripled easily; it's pretty hard to mess up frosting.

Whipped Topping - Sugar Free


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 3 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Simply whip the cream with the pudding mix. Use your electric mixer, or, if you like, a whisk-neither a blender nor a food processor will work. Stop whipping as soon as your topping is nice and thick, or you'll end up with vanilla butter. If you make this ahead of time, refrigerate it until you're ready to serve dessert.

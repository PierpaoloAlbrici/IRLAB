Mahogany Buttercrunch Toffee


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 1 1/4 cup of sugars, brown


 - 2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 14 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 6 ounce of candies, semisweet chocolate


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place almonds on a cookie sheet and bake them for 5-10 minutes until golden. Watch carefully, they go from getting hot to dark brown in just a few seconds! Cool to room temperature. In a food processor pulse the almonds until they are finely chopped. Sprinkle half of the nuts over a 7 inch by 10 inch area of a greased baking sheet. Set aside. In a medium, heavy saucepan combine the brown sugar, water and butter. Have your baking soda and vanilla extract ready. Over medium heat bring the sugar mixture to boil. Stir occasionally to prevent burning until the mixture reaches 285 degrees F. (soft-crack stage). Immediately remove the saucepan from the heat as the temperature will rapidly rise. Immediately add the baking soda and vanilla extract. Pour this mixture over the nuts on your baking sheet. Quickly scatter the chocolate over the hot toffee. Press lightly so it starts melting. After about five minutes, the chocolate will be soft enough to spread with a long metal spatula in an even layer over the toffee. Spread the remaining chopped almonds over the melted chocolate. Cool completely and break into irregular pieces using a sharp knife. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for about one month. Makes one pound. Can be doubled.

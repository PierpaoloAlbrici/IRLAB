### Ingredients

 - 12 ounce of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

 - 2 tablespoon of vinegar, cider

 - 2 tablespoon of orange juice, raw

 - 4 teaspoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 4 cup of shortening, vegetable, household, composite

 - 2 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

### Instructions

To make the sauce, in a bowl mix honey, apple cider vinegar, orange juice, soy sauce, and cornstarch. Set aside. Heat olive oil in a large wok or skillet. Add veggies and cook until tender-crisp (about 3 or 4 minutes). Remove veggies from wok. Add more oil if needed before adding chicken. Cook chicken for 3 or 4 minutes, or until no longer pink. Push the chicken to the sides of the pan and pour the sauce into the center (give the sauce a quick mix before doing this). Allow the sauce to bubble and thicken, while gently stirring. Then return the veggies to the pan and cook until heated through and all ingredients are coated with glaze. Serve over rice.

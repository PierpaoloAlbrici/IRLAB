### Ingredients

 - 300 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 150 g of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 120 ml of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 dash of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Add all of the ingredients into a bowl and mix it until they gather together. Let sit for 5 minutes. Knead well for 15 minutes. Place the dough in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Let sit until it has doubled in size. I placed it in a styrofoam container and controlled the temperature by putting boiling water, at 30C, into a bottle. I let it sit for 80 minutes and it expanded to this size. Let Step 3 rest in the refrigerator for about 8 hours. Shape the dough. Melt the butter in a heated frying pan and cook both sides of the naan.

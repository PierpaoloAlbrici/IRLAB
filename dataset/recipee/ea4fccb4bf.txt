Vegan Eggnog Waffles


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of oats


 - 12 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 cup of beans, snap, green, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 12 teaspoon of pumpkin, raw


 - 2 1/2 cup of eggnog


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 4 teaspoon of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Put the oatmeal (either regular or quick cooking) in the food processor and blend until fine. Add the other dry ingredients (flours, spice, and baking powder) and pulse until combined. Add the wet ingredients and pulse until well mixed. Heat your waffle maker and grease in whichever way you prefer. Cook the waffles until crispy. I found that it took 5 minutes per batch. Serve warm with more maple syrup.

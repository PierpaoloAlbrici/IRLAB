In a large bowl, combine almond flour and salt. In a smaller bowl, combine grapeseed oil, agave and vanilla. Stir wet ingredients into dry. Chill dough in freezer for 30 minutes. Between 2 pieces of parchment paper, roll out dough 1/4 to 1/8 inch thick. Use a cookie cutter to cut out 2 hearts of the same size. Take a smaller heart cookie cutter to cut out the center of one of the hearts. Press your thumb into the solid heart to make an indentation, then fill this spot with jam. Place the hollow heart on top of the jam covered heart. Bake hearts at 350 degrees on a parchment lined baking sheet for 5-7 minutes until brown around the edges. Cool and Serve.

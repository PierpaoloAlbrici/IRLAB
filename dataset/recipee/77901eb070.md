### Ingredients

 - 13 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, brown

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 5 ounce of candies, semisweet chocolate

 - 34 cup of dulce de leche

 - 1 quart of ice creams, vanilla

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 12-cup muffin pan well. In a food processor pulse the flour, 1/4 cup coconut, brown sugar and salt until well combined. Add the cold butter, continue to pulse until butter is incorporated, with pea sized pieces. Put 1 heaping tablespoon of the mixture in each muffin cup and press to make even rounds and up the sides about 1/4 inch. Bake on middle rack until crusts are golden, around 20 minutes. Turn off oven. Remove pan and sprinkle the chocolate evenly between the 12 baked tart shells. Return pan to oven for 2 to 3 minutes-just until the chocolate is melted. Sprinkle each crust with 1 tablespoon of the remaining coconut. Cool for 5 minutes, then place in freezer for at least 15 minutes. Using a thin spatula gently remove each crust from the muffin pan. Top with a small scoop of coconut ice cream, drizzle with dulce de leche and garnish with more toasted coconut.

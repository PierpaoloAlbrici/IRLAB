### Ingredients

 - 12 ounce of egg substitute, powder

 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season with salt. Add egg noodles and cook according to directions on package. Drain. Add noodles and butter to a large nonstick skillet and cook on medium-high until about half of the noodles are crispy, about 10 minutes. Stirring only occasionally so that the noodles set on the bottom and will crisp up. Serve warm. I love sprinkling just a bit of salt on top for a great buttery, salty flavor.

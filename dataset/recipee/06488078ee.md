### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of bacon, meatless

 - 1 pound of bacon, meatless

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 275 deg F. Spread the cubes out in a deep baking dish, place in oven. Stir every once in a while as the fat renders into a clear liquid. When the baking dish contains only clear liquid and browned bits (about 2 hours), carefully remove the dish from the oven (letting the cracklings color richly gives the lard a fuller, roastier flavor). Let the lard cool to lukewarm, then strain. Store the lard in a tightly sealed jar in the refrigerator (freeze if you won't use it all within a month).

### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 28 ounce of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 3/4 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 tablespoon of cornstarch

 - 18 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Add cocoa in a medium bowl and pour in enough coconut milk (about 23 cup), whisking to make a smooth paste. Stir in vanilla. Stir in sugar, cornstarch and salt in a medium saucepan. Slowly whisk in the remaining coconut milk. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the mixture starts to gently simmer around the edges. Then, stirring frequently and scraping the sides and corners of the pan to prevent scorching, allow the mixture to simmer for about 3 minutes to fully cook the cornstarch. Transfer the hot mixture into the bowl with the cocoa mixture. Whisk until well mixed. Allow to cool, undisturbed, for about 46 minutes. Cover and chili until cold, at least 4 hours or over-night. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker. Freeze according to manufactureraTMs directions. Freeze until the ice cream firms up. Serve.

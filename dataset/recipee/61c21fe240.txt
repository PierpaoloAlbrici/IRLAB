Spread mixture onto prepared baking sheet. Bake 20 minutes then remove from oven and gently stir. Place back in oven and bake 15 minutes more. Remove sheet from oven and place on a wire cooling rack. (Some pieces of granola may still seem slightly soft. They will crisp up as the cool.) 4. With granola still on baking sheet, carefully stir in dried apples and cranberries, if using. Allow granola to cool completely before placing in an airtight container. Keeps up to 2 weeks at room temperature. Serve alone as a snack, over yogurt or fruit, or with milk as a cereal.

-- Tasty Dish's -- Heffalumps and Woozles


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of oil, corn, peanut, and olive


 - 1 cup of pretzels, soft, unsalted


Instructions: 

Put the peanuts and pretzels together in a bowl one by one. Mix. Then eat. Sing along with me: They're extraordinary! So better bewary! Because they come in every shape and size, size, size, size. If honey's what you covet you'll find that they love it. Because they'll guzzle up the thing you prize!

Kids' Favorite Cheese Sauce


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of cheese, cheddar


 - 34 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular


 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Dice the cheddar cheese (medium or mild is best) into 1/2 inch cubes. Melt in double boiler on medium heat or in microwave at 30 second intervals, stirring frequently to help it melt. Once the cheese is about half melted, stir in the mayonnaise a tablespoon or two at a time. Depending on the desired consistency, you may wish to adjust the amount of mayonnaise. When the cheese is thoroughly melted, slowly add the milk, stirring constantly. The sauce should have a grainy texture once it has enough milk. Add salt and sugar to taste. Sharper cheeses generally need more sugar and less salt. (Note: I tried using low fat mayonnaise the other day, and it turned out much sweeter than I wanted. It still tasted great on the broccoli, but apparently low-fat mayo has sugar in it, so check your ingredients! ). Pour over cooked broccoli or fried/poached eggs and serve. To reheat, place in microwave for 30 second intervals, stirring each time.

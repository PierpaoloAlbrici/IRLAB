Quick Mushroom Supreme


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of mushrooms, portabella, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw


 - 12 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 12 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard


Instructions: 

In a large skillet over medium heat, saute the sliced mushrooms in the butter (or oil) for 3 or 4 minutes, till juices are released. Add the beef base and stir quickly to dissolve it in the mushroom juices. Reduce heat to low and stir in the cream till well combined. Sprinkle on the Parmesan and mix gently to coat mushrooms with the cheese. Serve at once, with a well-seared medium-rare steak is suggested. Serves 6 as a side dish; serves 8 as a garnish. To serve with roast chicken, substitute chicken base for the beef base.

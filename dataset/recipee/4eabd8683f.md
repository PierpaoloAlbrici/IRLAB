### Ingredients

 - 1 1/3 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 1/3 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 2 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 1/2 pound of sweet potato, raw, unprepared

 - 1/4 cup of raisins, seeded

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, canola

 - 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla extract

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F (175C). Lightly oil an 8-inch-square baking dish, place on a baking sheet with a rim, and set aside. In a large bowl, combine both coconut milks and sugar; stir until the sugar dissolves. Add the remaining ingredients and stir well to combine. Pour into the prepared baking dish and carefully transfer on the baking sheet to the center of the oven. Bake 1 hour. Reduce temperature to 250F (120C) and bake 1 more hour, or until a golden crust forms and a knife inserted halfway from the center comes out almost clean. Let cool about 30 minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature (the pudding will firm as it cools). Or cover and refrigerate completely cooled pudding up to 3 days and serve chilled.

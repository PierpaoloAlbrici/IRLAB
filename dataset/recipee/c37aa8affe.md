### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of oats

 - 1 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow

 - 3 cup of wheat germ, crude

 - 1 cup of sugars, brown

 - 34 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 325. Mix together dry ingredients. Bring oil and sugar to a boil. Pour over dry ingredients and mix thoroughly and quickly to keep sugar from clumping. Mixing with hands can help with this. Spread on 2 greased cookie sheets. Bake about 30 minutes, stirring often. Allow to cool and then break into small pieces. Serve with milk, yogurt or over fresh fruit.

### Instructions

Great ingredient. Whole seeds can keep their flavor for years, but once in liquid, they become soft and easy to chew, while retaining their individual integrty. Makes a great gift! The proportions do not need to be precise. Substitute grnd seeds if you have to. Store in a cold dark place. USE to flavor the water to cook vegetables like artichokes. Just dump some seeds generously into the boiling water. Add in to vegetable soup purees - like carrot. Add in to braised meats for roasts and stews, like Succulent Lamb Shanks (Sunset) see recipe.

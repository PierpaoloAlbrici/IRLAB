Stuffed Mushrooms - Low Carb


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of mushrooms, white, raw


 - 18 cup of mushrooms, white, raw


 - 4-6 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 12 pound of pork sausage, link/patty, unprepared


 - 14 cup of sauce, ready-to-serve, pepper, tabasco


Instructions: 

Mix cooked sausage, cream cheese, mushroom stems and crushed pork rinds in a bowl. Place mushrooms in a microwave-proof glass container, I typically use the 9" cake pan. Stuff with filling, cover with plastic wrap, and fold back a corner of the plastic wrap. Cook on high in the microwave for 5-6 minutes, or until mushrooms are moist and stuffing has melted a little. Leftover stuffing can be rolled into balls and cooked in the sausage grease.

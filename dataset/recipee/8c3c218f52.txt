Baked Cauliflower With Cheese


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of cauliflower, raw


 - 34 cup of cheese, pasteurized process, american, without added vitamin d


 - 12 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Toss all ingredients except cream and pour into a deep baking dish. Pour cream over top. Bake at 350 degrees (or whatever temp your main dish needs), covered, until desired doneness. I like it a little al dente, but it's great softer, too. Al dente from frozen takes about half an hour, a little longer if using fresh cauliflower.

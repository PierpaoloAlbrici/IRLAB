### Ingredients

 - 3 1/2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 12 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 3 tablespoon of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat

### Instructions

In a medium saucepan over medium heat, warm milk to 185 degrees, stirring constantly to prevent sticking. Add dry milk to warmed milk and whisk until dissolved. Place pan in a large bowl with ice water and cool milk down to 110 degrees. Place 3 T yogurt in a small bowl and mix with about 1/2 cup of warm milk. Pour pan of warm milk into a one quart jar, then add yogurt mixture. Partially fill a 1 gallon drink cooler with 110 degree water (I use one with the spout in the lid, but any small cooler will work). Place jar in cooler and make sure the water comes up to just below the lid. Cover cooler and place in a warm, sunny spot in your yard for 6-8 hours! The sun will help the yogurt stay nice and warm while it incubates. Refridgerate and enjoy!

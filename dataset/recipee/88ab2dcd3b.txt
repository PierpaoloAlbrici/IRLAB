Bacon Wrapped Water Chestnuts


Ingredients


 - 8 ounce of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 pound of bacon, meatless


 - 3/4 cup of catsup


 - 13 cup of sugars, brown


Instructions: 

Drain water chestnuts and place on paper towels to remove moisture. (I sometimes will cut the water chestnuts in half if very large.) Cut bacon into halves. Wrap half slice of bacon around a water chesnut and hold it in place with a toothpick. Place on a cookie sheet. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. While baking, mix ketchup and brown sugar together. Remove pan from the oven, and pour the mixture over each water chestnut. Return to the oven and cook for 10-15 minutes more. Best if served warm.

Instructions: 

Add all ingredients to a medium bowl and mix one minute until ingredients are uniformly distributed. Place in an oiled 2 cup measuring cup and cover. Let rest for 10 minutes and begin kneading on a lightly floured surface. Knead for 5 minutes (it's a stiff dough) and place back into the cup and cover. in 20 minutes, remove the dough, stretch into a rectangle as large as possible without tearing and fold letter-style, top to bottom third and bottom to top third. Do this from sides as well. Replace into measuring cup and cover. In 20 minutes, do another stretch and fold and replace into cup. Let rest in a warm place until doubled in volume. This make take another hour to hour and 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 350&deg;F A baking stone can be used if desired. Divide the dough into 2 equal halves and roll one half out on a lightly floured surface until it resists rolling. Do the same with the other half. Return to the first dough piece and continue to roll out until each piece is a 12" x 15" rectangle or a 15" diameter circle. Lift the doughs occasionally and return to the surface and re-flour lightly as needed. Cover each dough with a thin towel or plastic wrap lightly to prevent sticking (can use flour or oil to prevent sticking but not usually necessary). Let rest for 5 minutes. Lift the dough and place onto a half size baking sheet (12" x 16" or so) that has been fitted with parchment paper or silpat pad. Spray the doughs with water lightly and sprinkle toppings (sesame seeds, poppy seeds, sea salt, Italian seasonings and/or paprika). Lightly press or roll the toppings into the dough. Instead of water, an egg wash or milk wash can be applied. Using a fork, press holes into the dough to reduce the bubbling that flatbreads all do. Bake for 4 minutes and rotate pan or pans and bake for an additional 5 minutes or until the crackers are uniformly browned lightly and crispy. Remove and cool on the pan, counter or rack.

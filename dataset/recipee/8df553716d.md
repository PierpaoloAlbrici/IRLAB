 - 3 tablespoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

I couldn't get this put in the ingredients because it didn't recognize it, but you'll need 10 popcicle molds or plastic cups and 10 popcicle sticks. In a saucepan, combine the sugar, flour and cocoa. Gradually stir in milk until smooth. Bring to a boil over medium heat; cook and stir for 2 minutes or until thickend. Cool slightly. Pour 1/4 cup into each mold or plastic cup; top with holders and insert popsicle sticks. Freeze until set. May be frozen for up to 3 months.

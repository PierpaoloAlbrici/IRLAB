### Ingredients

 - 3 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated

 - 34 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Combine first 3 ingredients in a 2-cup glass measuring cup; let stand 5 minutes. Combine yeast mixture, flour, and next 3 ingredients in a large bowl, stirring until well blended. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead 5 minutes. Place in a bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 30 minutes or until dough is doubled in bulk. Punch dough down, and knead lightly 4 or 5 times. Divide dough into 10 equal portions; roll each portion into an 8-inch circle. Cook each round on 1 side in a non-stick 8-inch skillet coated with cooking spray over medium heat about 2 minutes or until dough rounds are lightly browned. Cool crusts, and freeze in an airtight container up to 6 months.

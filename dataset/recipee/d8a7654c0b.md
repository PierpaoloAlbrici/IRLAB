### Ingredients

 - 1/4 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 1/2 pound of bacon, meatless

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Mix brown sugar, cayenne, and black pepper together in a medium bowl. Add bacon and toss. Line a baking sheet with a wire rack and lay bacon on the rack. Pat any remanding spice mixture on the bacon. Put the baking sheet on the top rack of the oven and bake until crisp, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven to a serving dish and let cool slightly before serving. *Note: If using thick cut peppered bacon, omit the pepper in this recipe. If I am making some for the kiddo, I leave out the cayenne pepper. Most times I just add the brown sugar for the kiddos.

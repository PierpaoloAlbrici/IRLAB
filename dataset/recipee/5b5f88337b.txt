Refrigerate the can of full fat coconut cream for 24-48 hours. Do not shake the can. In a sauce pan over medium heat, add strawberries and 1/2 teaspoon stevia. Mix until thickened, about 5-7 minutes. Pour strawberries and juice into a bowl and let cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, scoop out just the cream on top of the can of coconut creamdo not use the juice. Beat the cream until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla extract, remaining 1/2 teaspoon (or to taste) stevia, and the cooled strawberries. Beat until well incorporated. The mixture will liquefy. Using a measuring cup, scoop out 1/2 cup for each serving and divide evenly into 6 cups or bowls. Refrigerate until it slightly harden. Meanwhile, prepare the topping by adding strawberries and stevia in a bowl. Mix until combined. Refrigerate until ready to use. The longer the strawberries marinate with the sugar, the sweeter and juicer the strawberries will be. When ready to serve, evenly divide the marinated strawberries over the top.

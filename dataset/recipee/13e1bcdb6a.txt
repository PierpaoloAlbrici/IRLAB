Buckwheat Crackers With Sesame


Ingredients


 - 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 tablespoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 5 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 4 to 5 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees with the racks positioned inside in the middle and upper third. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Sift together the flours. Mix together the flours, sesame seeds and salt in a mixing bowl, in the bowl of a stand mixer, or in a food processor fitted with a steel blade. If using a mixing bowl, add the oil and cut in with a fork until the mixture is crumbly. In a stand mixer, mix at medium speed; in a food processor, pulse until crumbly. Add the water, and mix with your hands (or at medium speed in a mixer or food processor) until you can gather the dough into a ball. Lightly dust your work surface, and roll out the dough, or roll out between pieces of parchment, plastic or wax paper. Cut into desired shapes -- squares, diamonds or cookie-cutter shapes -- and place on the baking sheet, close together but not touching. Bake 15 to 20 minutes until lightly browned, switching the sheet trays halfway through from front to back and top to middle. Remove from the heat, and allow to cool on racks.

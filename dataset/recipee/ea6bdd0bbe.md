### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1/2 cup of lime juice, raw

 - 3/4 cup of cherries, sweet, raw

### Instructions

Dissolve sugar in water and lime juice. In a blender, blend the cherries and sugar/lime/water mixture until mostly smooth. (If you have a really nice bender you can probably get it completely smooth; mine left the cherries in little chunks which was fine with me.) Pour into popsicle molds and freeze until solid. Run warm water over the outside of the molds until you can release them easily. Eat immediately.

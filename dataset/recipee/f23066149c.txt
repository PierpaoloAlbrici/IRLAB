Wondra Instant Flour Substitute


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 teaspoon of cornstarch


Instructions: 

For each cup of all-purpose flour, combine flour and cornstarch. Sift 3 times (can be done through a sieve) then remove 3 tablespoons. This will aerate the flour and the weight will be right for the recipe.

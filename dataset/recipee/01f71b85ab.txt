Smoking Brisket Rub


Ingredients


 - 34 cup of spices, paprika


 - 14 cup of spices, pepper, black


 - 14 cup of salt, table


 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, chili powder


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, onion powder


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


Instructions: 

The night before you plan to smoke, mix all ingredients. Rub all over your "guest of honor," wrap in foil, plastic wrap or a large bag, and refrigerate overnight. (I use plastic wrap and squeeze all the air out. This seems to work best for me). 30 minutes before you will start cooking, take meat from the fridge and set it out to come to room temperature.

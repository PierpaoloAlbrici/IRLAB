 - 1 pound of baking chocolate, mars snackfood us, m&m's milk chocolate mini baking bits


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cover favorite cookie sheet with a layer of mini prezel knots (They shouldn't overlap and should have enough room to hardly touch). Set 1 hug on each pretzel center. Bake for 3 minutes. As soon as time is up, remove the pan and immediatly press one M&M on each Hug top gently (Chocolate should ooze into the pretzel holes! ). Allow to cool completly (They will cool quicker if put in the fridge). When completly cooled, remove with a spatula and store in an airtight container.

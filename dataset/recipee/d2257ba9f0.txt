Vinegar Gravy


Ingredients


 - 12 pound of butter, without salt


 - 12 cup of vinegar, cider


Instructions: 

Melt the butter in a large frying pan. Cook it until it is a medium dark brown. Carefully add the vinegar. Be real careful because the vinegar will cause the butter to boil and foam. When it is done foaming pour into a gravy boat and serve.

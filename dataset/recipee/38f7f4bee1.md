[38f7f4bee1](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/drinks/grapefruit-soda/)

### Ingredients

 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 3/4 cup of grapefruit juice, white, raw

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Into a small saucepan over medium heat, add the sugar and water. Bring to a simmer and stir until sugar completely dissolves (on my stove this only takes about 60 seconds). Remove from heat and set aside to cool. This is your simple syrup. In a bowl or pitcher, combine the grapefruit juice and 1/4 cup of the simple syrup. Stir to combine. Add 1 cup of club soda. Fill two glasses with ice and pour the soda mixture over the ice. Serve. Notes: There will likely be a little simple syrup left over. You can adjust the sweetness of your soda to your liking by adding more or less simple syrup as desired. A less sweet variety of grapefruit may require a little more simple syrup.

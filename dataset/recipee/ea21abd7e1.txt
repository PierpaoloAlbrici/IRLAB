Salad Al Forno


Ingredients


 - 1 tablespoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 14 cup of vinegar, red wine


 - 2 tablespoon of vinegar, red wine


 - 12 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 34 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 6 cup of cabbage, raw


 - 3 ounce of bacon, meatless


 - 3 cup of radicchio, raw


 - 3 cup of lettuce, cos or romaine, raw


Instructions: 

Make the vinaigrette: whisk together the mustard and 1/4 cup vinegar in a bowl. Slowly whisk in the olive oil; add up to 3/4 teaspoon salt, and then fold in the cabbage. Set aside for 1 hour, at room temperature, so the cabbage has a chance to marinate. Preheat broiler, lay out the bacon on a pie plate or baking sheet. Broil the bacon, turning once, for about 5 minutes, or until it browns. Remove the bacon from the broiler, and immediately add the remaining vinegar to the pan; swirl together, and pour the vinegar and bacon into the cabbage; toss to combine. Line a large platter or individual salad plates with the bitter greens and lettuces. Top with the cabbage mixture and serve immediately.

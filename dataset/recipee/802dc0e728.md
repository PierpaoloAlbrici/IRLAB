### Ingredients

 - 23 cup of lard

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 4 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

Measure lard and place in the freezer. Sift flour onto a piece of parchment or wax paper. Re-measure flour and sift again with salt into a mixing bowl. Using a pastry cutter, cut cold lard into the flour mixture until the dough resembles small peas. Do not overwork. Add 2 tablespoons milk and work into the dough using a fork. Add one or two more tablespoons of milk, working with a fork until the dough pulls together into a nice ball. Divide into two equal pieces and lightly work into disks. Wrap disks individually in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1/2 hour or up to one day. On a floured work surface, roll out into a 12-inch disk about 1/8 inch thick and place into a pie plate. Fill and bake according to your pie recipe. If a recipe calls for a pre-baked pie crust, pierce evenly around the crust with a fork and bake in a 400 degrees F oven for about 15 minutes or until golden brown. Makes one double crust or 2 single crusts.

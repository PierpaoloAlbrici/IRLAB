Brabant Potatoes


Ingredients


 - 4 pound of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Cut each potato into an even rectangular shape by cutting off the bottom, top, and sides, then cut into 1/2-inch cubes. (Discard irregularly shaped portions.) Put in a medium, heavy saucepan and add enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are slightly tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and drain on paper towels. Heat the oil in a large, deep, heavy pot or an electric deep-fryer to 360 degrees F. Add the potatoes and fry, turning to brown evenly, for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels. Season with salt, and serve hot.

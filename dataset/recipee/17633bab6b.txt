Chocolate-Dipped Cherries With Pistachios


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of nuts, pistachio nuts, raw


 - 4 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 4 ounce of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 1 pound of cherries, sweet, raw


Instructions: 

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Place the pistachios in a shallow bowl and set aside. Place chocolate in a medium bowl and set aside. Bring cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Pour hot cream over chocolate and let sit for about 30 seconds; stir until the chocolate melts completely. Holding by the stem, dip the bottom of a cherry in the chocolate mixture, lightly shake off excess chocolate, and dip the cherry in the chopped pistachios. Transfer to the prepared sheet pan. Repeat with remaining cherries, refrigerate for 10 minutes, and store in a cool, dry place. Cherries will keep for several hours. Enjoy!

Instructions: 

Spray an 8-inch baking dish with coconut oil. In a food processor, pulse almonds, peanuts, and rice cereal together until broken into small pieces. Add dates, maple syrup, peanut butter and 1 tablespoon coconut oil. Blend until the mixture forms a crust-like texture. You may need to stop blending to scrape the side of the bowl or separate the mixture and blend again. Add a teaspoon of coconut oil (or a couple more dates) if the dough is too dry. When ready, remove the dough and press into pan coated with coconut oil spray. Melt the chocolate chips, sea salt and remaining 1 tablespoon coconut oil over medium heat until melted (use a double boiler if possible). Spread the melted chocolate over the peanut butter crust and spread with a spatula or spoon until even. Freeze for 12 hours. Cut into bars and serve. Makes 15 bars. These bars will stay good in the fridge for 56 days. You can also freeze them and theyll last even longer. Just set out for 1015 minutes to defrost before eating.

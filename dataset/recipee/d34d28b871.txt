Buttery Lobster/Shellfish Dipping Sauce


Ingredients


 - 13 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 3-4 drop of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

Time your cooking of this to work with your lobster or clams that you are steaming. Both should arrive at the table at the same time. Once the butter is melted in a small skillet (low-medium heat), add the garlic, and mix. Add the hot red pepper sauce, being sure to blend immediately with a spatula, otherwise some brands will just remain little lumps in your skillet. Reduce to low heat. Just prior to removing from the heat, add the lemon juice, and mix with spatula. (If the skillet is too hot, there may be some splattering). Serve the lobster and/or clams then bring the butter to the table, and enjoy.

[cbe082a220](http://www.food.com/recipe/everything-topping-bagels-rolls-bread-421678)

### Ingredients

 - 1 tablespoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, poppy seed

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 2 tablespoon of onions, raw

 - 34 tablespoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Put all ingredients into a jar with a tight fitting lid and shake until ingredients are distributed evenly. Store tightly covered. Always shake well before using. For bread topping: I lightly brush the loaves with egg white just before baking and sprinkle with this topping. Actual number of servings will depend on how light or how heavy you shake/ sprinkle this on. If I had to guess I would guess I use about 3/4-1 tbsp per loaf of bread.

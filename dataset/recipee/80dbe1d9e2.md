[80dbe1d9e2](http://www.cookstr.com/recipes/chicken-stir-fried-with-fresh-ginger)

### Ingredients

 - 2 tablespoon of sauce, fish, ready-to-serve

 - 1 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, brown

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 3/4 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, ginger, ground

 - 2 tablespoon of onions, spring or scallions (includes tops and bulb), raw

### Instructions

In a medium bowl, combine the fish sauce, soy sauce, honey, salt, and pepper, and stir to mix everything well. Add the chicken, and toss to coat with the seasonings. Set aside for 15 to 20 minutes, or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day. Heat the oil in a medium skillet over high heat until a bit of ginger sizzles at once. Add chicken and marinade and cook until the chicken is golden brown on one side, 1 to 2 minutes. Toss well, add the ginger, and toss again. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the chicken is nicely browned and cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a serving dish, sprinkle with the green onions, and serve hot or warm.

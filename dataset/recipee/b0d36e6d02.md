### Ingredients

 - 13 cup of butter, without salt

 - 2 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Cut softened butter into flour with a pastry blender or 2 forks just until butter cubes are coated with flour. Using your hands, gently combine until mixture resembles small peas. Stir in buttermilk with a fork just until blended. (Mixture will be wet. ). Turn dough out onto a generously floured surface, and pat to 1/2 inch thickness with your hands. Don't use a rolling pin here. Cut dough with a well-floured 2-inch round cutter, and place on lightly greased baking sheets. Bake at 450 degrees for 9-11 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from oven and brush warm biscuits with melted butter. Serve immediately. Easy Cheddar Biscuits: Add 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese to butter and flour mixture just before adding buttermilk. Proceed as directed.

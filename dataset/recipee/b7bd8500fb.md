### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of nuts, cashew nuts, raw

 - 1 cup of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F. In a large bowl, stir together butter and vanilla. Add sugar, salt and flour and stir; it will form a loose, crumbly mass like a moist pie dough. Stir in the nuts and chocolate chips. Press the dough into an ungreased cookie sheet, evenly and thinly (if you have an even single layer of chocolate chips across the whole pan, you have the right thickness). The sheet may not be full. Bake 23-25 minutes, until light golden brown. Let cool completely, then break into pieces. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.

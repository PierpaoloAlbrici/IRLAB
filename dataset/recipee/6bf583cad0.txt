Old fashioned kettle corn


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of corn, sweet, white, raw


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 dash of salt, table


Instructions: 

Place the oil in the bottom of a large pot along with 3 corn kernels. On a medium flame. When the 3 kernels pop the temp is just right. Add in the unpopped popcorn kernels and sugar. Give it a quick stir and put the lid back on. Over a medium heat start popping the popcorn, constantly shaking the pot to ensure that the popcorn kernels and oil do not burn. Once the popping has slowed down remove the pot from the heat and pour into a large bowl. Sprinkle a touch of salt.

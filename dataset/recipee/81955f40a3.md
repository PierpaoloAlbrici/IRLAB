### Ingredients

 - 8 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 2 tablespoon of raspberries, raw

### Instructions

Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler. Using a spatula, spread the white chcolate in a 10" square on the parchment paper. Evenly drizzle the raspberry puree over the white chocolate. Use a toothpick or skewer to swirl the puree through the chocolate for a decorative effect. Let the brittle sit at room temperature for 2-3 hours or until firm. Cut the brittle into the desired size pieces and remove the parchment paper. Handle carefully as the puree will be slightly sticky.

### Ingredients

 - 8 ounce of corn, sweet, white, raw

 - 1/2 cup of butter, salted

 - 1 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1/2 cup of syrups, corn, light

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 250 F. Put the corn curls on a large rimmed cookie sheet and spread them out in a single layer to fill pan. In a 2-quart pan cook butter, brown sugar and corn syrup for 2 minutes. When it boils, remove pan from heat, stir in the baking soda (the mixture will foam) and pour over the corn curls. Mix it well. Bake at 250 F for 45 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes. (I would remove pan from the oven when it is time to stir or you might get it all over your oven.) Remove from oven and allow to cool then break apart.

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350F (180C). Line a 12 x 15-inch (30 x 45-cm) baking sheet with foil and coat lightly with nonstick spray. Spread the Parmesan onto the baking sheet. Make sure that its spread evenly, or your crisps wont bake evenly. Sprinkle with the black pepper and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the cheese has turned a uniform deep golden brown. Remove from the oven and let cool. Once its cool enough to handle, remove the cheese from the foil and crack it into rough, bite-sized pieces. Store in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.

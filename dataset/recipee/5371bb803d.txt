Spiced Pear Preserves


Ingredients


 - 5 quart of pears, raw


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 13 cup of lemon juice, raw


 - 3 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground


Instructions: 

Using a slow cooker liner if youve got one, add all the ingredients to a 6-quart slow cooker. Stir to incorporate. Turn the slow cooker on high and place the lid on halfway. Forget about the preserves for 8-10 hours. Come back and stir the now-caramelized, reduced, and delicious preserves you effortlessly made. Taste and add any other desired spices. Ladle preserves into jars and hot water bath process for 15 minutes. Note: for those of you who dont can, check out the resources from fellow blogger Food In Jars (link in related blog post).

Curried Hummus


Ingredients


 - 1/4 cup of currants, zante, dried


 - 2 cup of lemon juice, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of seeds, sesame butter, tahini, from roasted and toasted kernels (most common type)


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, curry powder


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Place the currants in a small bowl of hot water to soak and plump up. Combine the chickpeas, water, lemon juice, tahini, olive oil, curry powder, ginger, and salt in a food processor and process until smooth. Transfer to a mixing bowl and do a FASS check. Add a spritz of lemon if it needs a little extra zing. Before serving, drain the currants thoroughly and stir them into the hummus. For a time-saving trick, buy a 16-ounce container of premade organic hummus at the market and add curry powder, ginger, lemon juice, and currants, as above. This is a wonderful way to spice up a store-bought snack. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 5 to 7 days.

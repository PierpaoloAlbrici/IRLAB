Fresh Horseradish


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of horseradish, prepared


 - 1 cup of vinegar, distilled


 - 4 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

This is something you need to do outside or the fumes will get to you. Cut horseradish roots into 1-inch cubes; chop very fine a little at a time in blender or food processor. Mix with vinegar and salt. Pack into sterilized jars, cover and ripen in refrigerator for 1 week before using. If you have baby food jars on hand this works very well for this recipe.

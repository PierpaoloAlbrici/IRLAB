Dallas Dandy Brisket


Ingredients


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, paprika


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, chili powder


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, onion powder


 - 2-4 pound of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw


Instructions: 

Combine spices to make a rub. Reserve 1 T rub for later. Rub brisket with remaining rub. Let sit in large ziplock in fridge overnight. Let brisket come to room temp for 45 min- 1 hr while smoker heats up to between 200-220 degrees. Smoke brisket for 3 hours. Wrap brisket in heavy duty foil, sprinkle with remaining 1 T rub and continue smoking until well-done and tender. ***Note: Briskets usually take 1 1/2 hours per pound in smoker. For slicing brisket thin, get internal temp to 180-190 degrees. For fall-apart tender, get internal temp to 195-205 degrees. ***Note: Trim brisket if fat is more than 1/4" thick. Make diagonal hatch marks across fat in a diamond pattern if necessary. Always smoke brisket with fat side up, the fat keeps the meat moist and juicy!

### Instructions

(Crust) In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Cut in butter with a pastry blender or food procesor (for a fluffier crust) until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in water, a tablespoon at a time, until mixture forms a ball. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate while cutting apples. Prepare your pastry for a two crust pie. Wipe, quarter, core, peel, and slice apples; measure to 6 cups. Combine sugar and cinnamon. Additional sugar may be needed if apples are tart. Roll dough out to fit a 9 inch pie plate. Place crust in pie plate. Press the dough evenly into the bottom and sides of the pie plate. Arrange apples in layers in pastry lined pie plate. Sprinkle the top layers with sugar and cinnamon. Dot top layer with small pieces of butter. Cover with top crust. Place on lowest rack in oven preheated to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake for 30 to 35 minutes longer. Serve warm.

Yummy Ginger Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 1 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 100 g of butter, without salt


 - 12 cup of sugars, brown


 - 13 cup of syrup, maple, canadian


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 160C, and line a tray with baking paper. Sift the flour and ground ginger into a large bowl. Add the crystallised ginger. Melt the butter, sugar and golden/maple syrup in a saucepan on medium heat, or in the microwave in 30 second bursts, mixing in between. Allow the mixture to come to the boil. Add melted butter, sugar and syrup to the dry ingredients and mix well. Roll 1 tbs of the mixture at a time into balls, then flatten slightly and place on the tray. Brush each biscuit with a small amount of water on a pastry brush, and sprinkle with brown sugar. Place tray in the preheated oven and bake for 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack, though I think these taste best when still warm!

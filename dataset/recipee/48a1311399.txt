Creamy Rice Pudding With Cardamom and Almonds


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 1 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 13 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, cardamom


 - 4-5 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 12 teaspoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 2-3 tablespoon of nuts, almonds


 - 1 tablespoon of cranberries, dried, sweetened


Instructions: 

In a medium saucepan, combine rice and water and bring to a boil; cover and cook, over medium-low heat, for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Uncover, increase heat to medium, and cook, stirring occasionally, until nearly all the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Add 3 1/2 cups milk and the salt and bring to a boil, over medium-high heat, stirring often; reduce heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered, stirring frequently, until rice is very soft, about 20 minutes. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup milk, simmering on low heat and stirring; stir in the almonds and cardamom until pudding is thickened to your liking, about 5 minutes (you'll probably want the pudding creamy, not soupy or dry). When the rice is cooked, add 4 tablespoons, or so, of sugar and cook 1 minute to dissolve the sugar; remove from heat and stir in the rosewater.Serve hot or cold, garnished with toasted sliced almonds and dried cranberries. If you are serving cold, cool it to room temperature, cover, and refrigerate (it will thicken as it cools); to serve, stir in a little more milk to achieve the consistency you want.

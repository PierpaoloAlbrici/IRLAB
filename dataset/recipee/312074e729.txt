Al's Italian Bread Recipe


Ingredients


 - 3 ounce of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 3 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 3 pound of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 tablespoon of shortening, vegetable, household, composite


Instructions: 

Dissolve yeast in 2 c. hot water. Combine flour, sugar and salt in mixing bowl. Make a well in center of mix; pour in yeast mix. Mix thoroughly with hands (Marino's method) or possibly dough hook of mixer. Gradually add in 1 to 2 c. remaining hot water; mix thoroughly. Dough should be sticky. Spread 2 Tbsp. shortening on top of dough; knead in. Cover dough with a cloth and set in a hot place to rise for 30 min. (Marino turns his electric oven to "hot" for a minute, turns it off, then puts the bowl of dough inside.) After 30 min, knead dough in bowl for about 3 min. Cover and return to hot spot to rise for 1 hour. Cut dough into 4 equal sections. Lightly flour counter and rolling pin; roll each section of dough into a rectangle. Roll up each piece of dough lengthwise, like a jelly roll. Shape each into a loaf, sealing the seam with the side of your hand or possibly knuckles. Sprinkle some cornmeal and sesame seeds on kitchen counter. Spread some hot water over top of each loaf with your hand; roll loaf over seeds and cornmeal. Sprinkle another counter lightly with cornmeal. Place finished loaves on top, cover with a towel and let rise for 15 min. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. (If using oven tiles or possibly a pizza stone, sprinkle them with some cornmeal and place in oven to heat.) Place risen loaves on warm oven tiles or possibly in lightly greased oblong cake pans, using 2 loaves per pan. (If baking the bread in pans, remove after 15 min and place the loaves directly on the top oven rack to finish baking; place empty pans on the bottom shelf to keep the bottom of the bread from overbrowning.) Bake 25 to 35 min or possibly till loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Yield: 4 loaves.

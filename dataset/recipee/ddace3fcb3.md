### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 2 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 pinch of spices, nutmeg, ground

 - 1/2 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard

### Instructions

Scald the milk in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Keep it warm over very low heat. Melt the butter in a separate saucepan over low heat. When it's bubbling, add the flour and whisk until it forms a golden paste, about 3 to 4 minutes. Whisking constantly, add the hot milk in a steady stream. Bring the milk to a gentle simmer and continue to whisk until the sauce thickens, about 10 minutes. Whisk in the nutmeg and the cheese, and serve at once

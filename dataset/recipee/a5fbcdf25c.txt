Roasted Tiny Potatoes


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Thoroughly wash potatoes and lightly pat dry to remove excess water. Dump potatoes into a medium, oven-safe dish so that potatoes are spread no more than two deep. Lightly drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the potatoes. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the potatoes (using more or less to taste) and mix with a spoon to spread the seasoning evenly. Roast uncovered for 45-50 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes and adding the remaining olive oil halfway through. Skins should begin to wrinkle and brown slightly. Remove from the oven and let them sit for five minutes before serving. Serve with everything! Inspired by The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook.

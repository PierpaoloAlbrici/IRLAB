Buttermilk Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 34 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 5 tablespoon of shortening, vegetable, household, composite


 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 425F. In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda. Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut the shortening into the flour mixture until coarse crumbs form. Add the buttermilk, tossing with a fork until a dough forms. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Gather into a disk. Knead lightly a few times just until smooth. (The dough can be made up to 2 hours ahead, wrapped in plastic wrap, and refrigerated until ready to use). Pat the dough to 3/4 inch thick. Using a biscuit cutter or a glass dipped in flour, cut out biscuits. Place the biscuits, on an ungreased baking sheet, 2 inches apart. Gather dough trimmings, pat to 3/4 inch thick and cut out more biscuits. Bake the biscuits until golden, 12-15 minutes. Serve hot.

Low-Fat Yogurt Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 14 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 2 tablespoon of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


 - 1 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 12 teaspoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Combine dry ingredients. Cut in margarine and mix until crumbly. Stir together yogurt and sugar. Add the yogurt mixture to the dry ingredients; mix just until moistened. If the dough is too sticky, add more flour. If it's too crumbly, add more yogurt. Turn onto a floured surface and knead 4-5 times. Grease a baking sheet with non-stick spray. Place dough on top and pat into a 6x4-inch rectangle. Cut into 6 square biscuits; do not separate. Brush tops with milk. Bake at 450F for 12-15 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown. These are best served warm, but they also store well and stay moist.

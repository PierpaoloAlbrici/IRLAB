### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 1/2 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 teaspoon of shortening, vegetable, household, composite

 - 6 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 13 cup of peppermint, fresh

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F (180C). In bowl, combine butter and powdered sugar and beat until light and fluffy. Add flour, cocoa powder and vanilla and mix well. On wax paper, roll out dough to 38 inch thickness. Cut into 1 1/2 to 2-inch strips, then into triangle shapes with two long sides and one short side. Place 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake in preheated oven 8 minutes, or until firm to the touch. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. To make frosting: In small saucepan, melt white chocolate and shortening, stirring frequently. Dip short sides into melted chocolate, letting excess drip off. Place on wax paper and let harden. Place remaining melted chocolate frosting into a plastic sandwich bag with one end snipped off. Pipe frosting over cookie in a side-to-side design to resemble a garland, then immediately sprinkle with peppermint candies. Let harden.

Instructions: 

For the blueberry sauce: In a small saucepan add all of the ingredients for the blueberry sauce.Bring the ingredients to a boil. Give the blueberries a quick mash with a potato masher and then turn the heat down to low so that the sauce is simmering. Let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes. For the oatmeal: In a medium sized saucepan add all of the oatmeal ingredients and bring the oatmeal to a boil. Turn the heat down to medium low and let the oats simmer for about 3 minutes or until they are thickened. Turn the heat off and cover the oatmeal with a lid for another 3 minutes. For the assembly: In two (oven/broiler-safe) 8-ounce canning jars, glasses, or bowls, start with a spoonful of the blueberry sauce on the bottom. Add a tablespoon of the chopped pecans on top of the blueberry sauce. Add a quarter of the oatmeal mixture to each parfait. Repeat this process once more ending with the oatmeal on top. Sprinkle the top of each parfait with a teaspoon of sugar. Using a kitchen blow torch or setting your oven to broil, brulee the tops of the parfaits until they are golden brown and crisp.

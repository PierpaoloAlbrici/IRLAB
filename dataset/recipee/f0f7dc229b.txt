Honeycomb Pecans


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 teaspoon of alcoholic beverage, distilled, rum, 80 proof


 - 3 cup of nuts, pecans


Instructions: 

Combine sugar, honey and water in a medium saucepan and stir well to mix. Bring this mixture to a boil (DO NOT STIR, so use a non-stick saucepan). Once the mixture begins to boil, cook it until it reaches a soft ball stage (240 degrees on a candy thermometer). Again, DO NOT STIR. Remove from heat and add flavorings, then stir to blend. Allow this mixture to cool to a lukewarm temperature. Once it becomes lukewarm, beat this with a hand mixer until it becomes creamy, about 3 minutes. Add pecans and stir until they are completely coated. Drop by heaping teaspoon onto wax paper and cool completely.

### Ingredients

 - 2 1/2 cup of raspberries, raw

 - 13 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 13 cup of sugars, powdered

### Instructions

Warm the water and sugar in a saucepan and stir until the sugar melts to form a light syrup. Add the berries and stir to combine. Heat for another minute or so, until the desired consistency is achieved. If a less lumpy sauce is required, process some to desired consistency. Another option is to push it thru a sieve or strainer if you dont want berry seeds in the syrup. Cool and refrigerate until required.

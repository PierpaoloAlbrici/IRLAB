Add onions, salt and pepper, then cook for 15 minutes, stirring frequently, to brown and cook onions. Add vinegar and caraway seed and stir well to mix. Simmer over medium heat for 30 minutes until mixture combines and thickens. Cool completely. Store in tightly sealed containers in refrigerator up to 3 weeks. Serve over a Brie cheese that has been heated in a 350 degrees F oven for 10-12 minutes, or over a room temp block of cream cheese. Also can be used as a sandwich spread. NOTE:.

This is called inversion canning.

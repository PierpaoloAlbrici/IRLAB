Pecan Sticky Buns


Ingredients


 - 14 cup of sugars, brown


 - 13 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


 - 9 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 34 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 2 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 1/4 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Grease a 9-inch round metal cake pan. Prepare filling: in small bowl, combine 1/4 cup brown sugar with cinnamon; set aside. Prepare topping: In 1-quart saucepan, heat honey, remaining 1/3 cup brown sugar and 2 T butter on medium until mixture is blended and smooth, stirring occasionally. Pour topping into prepared pan, and sprinkle evenly with pecans; set aside. Prepare dough: In large bowl, combine flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In small bowl, mix buttermilk and 5 T butter. With spoon, stir buttermilk mixture into flour mixture just until liquid is absorbed. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface, and knead 8-10 minutes or just until smooth, about 30 seconds. Pat dough into a 12-inch by 9-inch rectangle. Brush dough with 1 T butter, then sprinkle with filling. Starting at one short end, roll up dough jellyroll fashion. With seam side down, cut dough crosswise into 8 slices. Place each slice, cut side down, on pecan mixture in cake pan; brush with remaining melted butter. Bake buns 28-30 minutes or until golden. Remove pan from oven. Immediately place serving plate over top of pan and invert buns onto plate, allowing topping to run down sides. Remove baking pan. Cool buns slightly, about 10 minutes, to serve warm, or cool completely to serve later. Wrap any leftovers in foil, and store at room temperature up to 3 days.

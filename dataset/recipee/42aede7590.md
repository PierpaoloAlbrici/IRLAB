### Ingredients

 - 250 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 4 g of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 3 g of salt, table

 - 25 g of sugars, granulated

 - 30 g of egg substitute, powder

 - 110 g of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 25 g of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Put all of the ingredients in a bread machine and set to dough mode. The first rising should take about 60 minutes. Once the dough has doubled in size, take it then divide and shape into 50 g balls. Cover with a damp cloth and let rest for 10 minutes. Dust the dough with strong flour and using a rolling pin, roll out the dough as shown in the photo. Loosely roll up the dough, starting with the wide end. Place the rolls seam-side down on the oven pans, and let rise again. (40 minutes at 35% humidity, if you don't have a bread-rising setting on your oven). Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in size, at about 25C for 40-60 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180C. Brush any leftover beaten egg yolk on the rolls. Bake at 180C for 20-25 minutes, or until they are brown. Remove from oven, thump the pan on a hard surface, remove the rolls and cool on a rack. Let rest until they've cooled down a bit and enjoy. Put any leftover rolls in a plastic bag, and they'll stay soft even the next day.

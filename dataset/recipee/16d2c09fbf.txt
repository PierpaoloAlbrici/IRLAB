Perfect Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread


Ingredients


 - 2 1/3 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 4 tablespoon of honey


 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/2 cup of wheat germ, crude


 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


Instructions: 

In a bowl of standing mixer, add water, yeast, honey, butter and salt, and stir with rubber spatula until well mixed. Add the barley flour, wheat germ, and 1 cup of each whole wheat and white flours, and mix well. Add the remaining flour, turn on the mixer on low-speed, knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer the dough to a floured working surface or cutting board. Knead the dough until soft and smooth, 25 to 35 seconds. Arrange the dough in a lightly greased bowl. Cover with the plastic wrap or damp kitchen towel. Allow to rise in a warm area until the dough has doubled in volume, 50 to 60 minutes. Gently punch down the dough, then shape it. For the Sandwich style loaf: Grease two 9 by 5-inch loaf pans. Divide the dough into two equal portions. Gently press each portion into an oblong rectangle, about 1-inch thick and no wider than the length of the pan. With long side of the dough facing you, roll firmly into a cylinder, pressing down to make sure that the dough sticks to itself. Turn the dough seam side up and pinch it closed. Place each cylinder of dough into one of the prepared loaf pans and press it gently so it touches all four sides of the pan. For the Twisted Loaf: Grease two 9 by 5-inch loaf pans. Place the dough onto an unfloured working surface or cutting board, gently punch the dough, and divide it into a fat coil, 9 to 10-inch long. Arrange two logs side by side and wrap one around the other to make a twist. Place in a loaf pan and gently press down to let the dough touches all the sides of the pan. Repeat with the second loaf. For the Dinner Rolls: Sprinkle fine cornmeal over two baking sheets. Cut the dough into 16 4-ounce pieces. Roll each portion of dough into a ball on a cutting board or working surface. Loosely cover each baking sheet with a plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel. Let rise in a warm place for about 20 minutes until almost doubled in volume. Using scissors, make four to five cuts like the spokes of a wheel onto each of the fully risen dough balls. For the both of the loaf breads, after shaping them, cover shaped dough, let rise until almost doubled in volume, 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375F (190C). To bake the loaves, bake for 35 to 45 minutes; to bake the rolls, bake until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer the bread right away to a wire rack. Let cool to room temperature.

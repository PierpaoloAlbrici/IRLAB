### Ingredients

 - 100 ml of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 20 g of sugars, granulated

 - 20 g of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Put all the ingredients into a large bowl and microwave for 6 minutes. Remove from the microwave, mix gently with a wooden spatula, then microwave for another 3 minutes. Repeat Step 2. Remove from the microwave and mix well so the oil blends in. The key is to mix it very well here. Pour the batter onto parchment paper. It will be like a thick paste, so you don't need a mould. Chill it in the fridge or freezer, and cut it into bite sizes when it has hardened. It will harden quicker in the freezer.

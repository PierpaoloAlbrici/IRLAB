Toasted Spice Rub


Ingredients


 - 1/4 cup of spices, fennel seed


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, coriander seed


 - 1 tablespoon of corn, sweet, white, raw


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 1/4 cup of spices, chili powder


 - 2 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


Instructions: 

Put the fennel seed, coriander seed, and peppercorns in a small, heavy skillet over moderate heat. Watching carefully, toss the seeds frequently so they toast evenly. When the fennel seed turns light brown, work quickly. Turn on the exhaust fan, add the red pepper flakes, and toss, toss, toss, always under the fan. Immediately turn the spice mixture out onto a plate to cool. Pour the cooled spices into a blender and add the chili powder, salt, and cinnamon. Blend until the spices are finely and evenly ground. If you have a small spice mill or a coffee grinder dedicated to grinding spices, grind only the fennel, coriander, peppercorns, and red pepper flakes. Pour into a bowl and toss with the remaining ingredients. Keep the spice mix in an airtight container away from light and heat for up to 4 months, or freeze for up to 1 year.

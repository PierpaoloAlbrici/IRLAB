### Ingredients

 - 8 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

### Instructions

Cut the butter in 1-inch pieces and place the pieces into the work bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the sugar and cinnamon. Starting on slow speed, beat until the ingredients begin to incorporate. Turn up the speed to medium-high and whip until all the ingredients are well incorporated. The outside of the mixing bowl should feel cool. If the bowl begins to get too warm, stop the mixer and refrigerate the bowl for 15 minutes before continuing. When all the ingredients are well mixed, use a spatula to scrape the butter onto a large piece of parchment paper or wax paper. Roll the butter into a long tube that is 1 or 2 inches in diameter, and twist the ends to seal in the butter. Chill for at least several hours. Alternatively, scrape the butter into a ramekin and cover it with plastic wrap before chilling. When you are ready to serve the butter, cut it into rounds and remove the parchment paper. Alternatively, simply put it on the table in its ramekin.

### Ingredients

 - 14 cup of nuts, pine nuts, dried

 - 2 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 13 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

 - 23 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 14 cup of spices, basil, dried

### Instructions

In a 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan cook pine nuts in oil over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 2 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer pine nuts to a bowl. Add rice to oil in pan and cook over moderately low heat, stirring, 1 minute. Add water and bring to a boil. Cover rice and cook over very low heat until water is absorbed and rice is tender, about 18 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let rice stand undisturbed for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, finely chop basil. Fluff rice with a fork and stir in basil, pine nuts, and salt and pepper to taste.

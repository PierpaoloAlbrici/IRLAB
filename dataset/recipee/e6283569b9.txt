Pita Bread


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 4 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


Instructions: 

Combine warm water, sugar, salt, yeast and oil in a bowl. Let it sit for about 15 minutes. Mix in flour one cup at a time. This should be a soft dough. (Dont worry if its sticky. It will pick up the flour off the counter during kneading and rolling later on.) Let it rise 20 minutes. Knead for about two minutes on a floured counter. Divide dough into 12 balls. Let the balls rise again for 30 minutes. Roll out the balls on a floured counter, from the center out. (Thats the trick to getting the bubble in the middle!) Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. Cook the breads directly on the oven rack (middle) for 3-4 minutes. Stuff with chicken salad (grapes, chicken, celery, chicken, Miracle Whip, and lettuce) or whatever you like in your pitas. *I keep our rolling pin in the freezer at all times, flour and all!

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of blueberries, raw

 - 1 cup of raspberries, raw

 - 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 3/4 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1/2 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat

 - 1 tablespoon of cornstarch

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a deep sided 8-inch baking dish. Put the berries in the dish and squeeze lemon juice over berries. Stir and set aside. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together flour, 1/2 cup of the sugar and baking powder. Add the melted butter and yogurt. Mix until you have a thick batter. Spoon over the berries. You will need to smooth it out evenly, as the batter is quite thick. Dont worry if some of the berries are peeking through. In a separate bowl, whisk together cornstarch and remaining sugar. Sprinkle this evenly over the batter and pour over boiling water. Bake for approximately 3035 minutes. A toothpick inserted in the cake part should come out clean.

Bite Sized Brownies (Egg-Free)


Ingredients


 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 14 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 12 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 tablespoon of seeds, flaxseed


 - 18 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 18 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 14 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


 - 34 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 14 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Melt butter and chocolate either using your microwave or a double boiler. Stir to combine. Stir in sugar and vanilla extract. Combine flax seed meal in a microwafe safe bowl and microwave on high for 30 seconds. Add to the chocolate butter mixture and stir to combine. In another bowl combine salt, baking soda, cocoa and flour. Add the wet ingredients and stir with a spatula until just combined. The dough will be very thick. I needed to add about 1/4 c milk to achieve a thick, but smooth dough. This will depend on the flours and chocolate you use, so eyeball it. Transfer dough to a paper-lined or greased mini muffin tin and bake in the preheated oven at 180C/350 F for 15-20 minutes. The top should be firm, but a toothpick inserted into the centre should still hold some crumbs. Cool on a wire rack.

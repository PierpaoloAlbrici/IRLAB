 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, caraway seed

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, onion powder

### Instructions

Combine the rye flour, all-purpose flour, caraway seed, salt, onion powder, and garlic powder in a bowl. Stir in the canola oil and honey. While stirring with a fork, slowly add the water until the dough comes together in a ball. Cover and rest for 10 minutes. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Divide the dough into 4 sections, rolling each piece out on parchment paper to 1/8 inch thick. Cut into desired shape then place on a baking sheet. Prick each cracker a few times with a fork. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are brown and the crackers are crisp, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove immediately to a cooling rack.

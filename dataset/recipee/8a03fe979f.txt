Ingredients


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 2 cup of cauliflower, raw


 - 12 cup of denny's, hash browns


 - 1 1/2 cup of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry

Instructions: 

Melt the butter and olive oil together in a saucepan. Add the onion and frozen hash browns and saute gently for 10 minutes. Stir in the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Add the cauliflower flowerettes, then lower the heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Take pan off the heat and either pour into a blender or food processor or easier than that, use a stick blender to roughly puree. Add mixture back to the saucepan and add the skim milk while off the heat. Add the shredded cheese and gently heat until simmering. Add salt and pepper to taste.

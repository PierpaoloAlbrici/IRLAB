Ingredients


 - 2 1/2 cup of goji berries, dried


 - 3 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 cup of syrups, corn, light


 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

Note: Instructions for making berry juice to use for this syrup are included below. To make the syrup, combine all ingredients. Bring to a full rolling boil and boil exactly 1 minute. Remove from heat and pour into sterilized pint jars. Cover with lids and jar rings and process in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes. * To make berry juice, wash the berries well and put them in a large saucepan. Heat, stirring and mashing, until they are hot and juicy. Press them through a colander, and then strain the juice through a jelly bag or two layers of cheesecloth. (Sometimes the natural pectin content of the berries is so great that this turns to jelly rather than syrup.)

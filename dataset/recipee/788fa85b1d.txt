Cheap, Clean Mirrors, No Streaks


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of vinegar, distilled


 - 3 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Mix ingredients together. Put in spray bottle (I don't even use one but I'm sure it's best). Shake well, then spray onto dirty mirrors or glass and wipe off with a cotton cloth or old t-shirt until dry. See your face again!

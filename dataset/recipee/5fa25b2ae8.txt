 - 2 cup of orange juice, raw


 - 1 cup of limeade, frozen concentrate, prepared with water

Mix all together. We prefer Bacardi Gold for dark rum. I have used Bacardi Limon and Malibu Pineapple rum before and both are GREAT! I have sliced oranges, lemons and limes and added for extra fresh flavor.

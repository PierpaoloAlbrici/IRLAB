Benne Seed Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried


 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 23 cup of lard


 - 23 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Place the benne seeds in a shallow pan and roast for 5 minutes. They should be the color of butterscotch and have a delicious toasted smell. If they're not ready, shake the pan to toss and return to the oven for 1 to 2 minutes, but be careful not to burn them. Sift the flour, baking powder and teaspoon of salt into a large bowl. Add the lard and work the mixture with a pastry blender or your fingertips until it has the texture of cornmeal. Add the milk and mix well. Mix in the benne seeds. Place the dough on a floured surface, knead for a few seconds and shape into a ball. Roll the dough out to about 1/8-inch thickness. Using a 2-inch biscuit cutter, stamp out rounds and lay them on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for about 12 minutes, until lightly browned. Remove from the oven, sprinkle with a little bit of salt and serve hot. The biscuits may be stored in an airtight tin or jar; reheat before serving.

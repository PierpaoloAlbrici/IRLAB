Soft Wrap Bread


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 14 cup of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 1 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


Instructions: 

Place 2 cups of the flour into a bowl or the bucket of a dough mixer. Pour the boiling water over the flour, and stir till smooth. Cover the bowl or bucket and set the mixture aside for 30 minutes. In a seperate bowl, whisk together the potato flour (or flakes or buds) and the remaining 1 cup of flour with the salt, oil and yeast. Add this to the cooled flour/water mixture, stir, then knead for several minutes (by hand, or mixer) to form a soft dough. Continue mixing for 5 minutes. The dough should form a ball, but will remain somewhat sticky. Add additional flour only if necessary; if kneading by hand, keep your hands and work surface lightly oiled. Let the dough rise, covered, for 1 hour. Divide the dough into 8 pieces (each about the size of a handball, cover, and let rest for 15-30 minutes. Roll each piece into a 7"-8"-circle, and dry-fry them (fry without oil) over medium heat for about 1 minute per side, until they're puffed and flecked with brown spots. Adjust the heat if they seem to be cooking either too quickly, or too slowly; cooking too quickly means they may be raw in the center, while too slowly will dry them out. Transfer the cooked breads to a wire rack, stacking them to keep them soft. Serve immediately, or cool slightly before storing in a plastic bag.

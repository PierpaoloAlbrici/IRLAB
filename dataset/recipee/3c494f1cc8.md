### Ingredients

 - 1/2 pound of butter, without salt

 - 1/2 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 cup of nuts, pecans

### Instructions

Cream the butter and sugar in a standing mixer. Slowly add flour, then salt. Fold in pecan pieces. Roll dough into ball shape, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. On floured surface, roll dough out to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut into desired shapes (squares and triangles are my favorite, but a round cookie cutter can be used). Transfer cut out dough to ungreased cookie sheet. Prick with fork and chill again for 20 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Bake 20 minutes or until edges are lightly browned.

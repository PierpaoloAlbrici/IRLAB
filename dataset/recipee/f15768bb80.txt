Cheese-Flavored Okara Crackers in the Microwave


Ingredients


 - 80 g of okara


 - 20 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched


 - 3 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 6 g of sugars, brown


 - 3 g of salt, table


Instructions: 

Combine all ingredients except for the vegetable oil. Mix so that the water from the okara blends evenly with the other ingredients. There's no need to dry-roast the okara. Add vegetable oil and stir until smooth. Gather into one lump. Press it down with the back of a spoon, or use your hands. Cover your workplace with parchment paper and spread out the dough to about 3 mm thick. Poke in holes with a fork. Microwave for 5 minutes. Take it out when it's half-done, and chop into desired sizes. (*Leave the microwave open to expel the humidity.) (*Wipe water droplets in the microwave.) Flip it over and microwave for another 3 to 4 minutes. Set aside to cool, and they're done. [Variation] Add herbs or aonori seaweed if you like!

### Ingredients

 - 125 g of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt

 - 75 g of nuts, hazelnuts or filberts

 - 75 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 25 g of sugars, powdered

 - 75 g of cheese, cottage, creamed, large or small curd

 - 500 g of raspberries, raw

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 180C Put the margerine, hazelnuts, flour, and sugar in a food processor and whizz together until it forms a dough. If you don't have a food processor, rub the mix between your fingers and thumbs to make the dough. If you need to bind the dough, add a touch of water, but don't let it become too sticky. Line the base and sides of the tart tin by pressing the pastry into place with your fingers. If it feels to sticky to press into the tin, chill the dough in the freezer for 5 minutes beforehand. Throw some baking beans into the tin and bake blind for 30 minutes until the pastry is golden brown. Fill the tart with the lemon tart and artfully arrange the raspberries on top. Serve while it's still warm to catch it at its most delicious.

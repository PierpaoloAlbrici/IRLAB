Texas Style Beef Brisket Recipe


Ingredients


 - 4-5 pound of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw


 - 1 cup of catsup


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, brown


 - 2 tablespoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 2 tablespoon of sauce, worcestershire


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 2 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


Instructions: 

Combine ketchup, brown sugar, prepared mustard, Worcestershire sauce, warm pepper sauce and cinnamon. Combine 1/4 c. ketchup mix with flour. Cover and chill remaining sauce. Put tenderizer on meat brisket; then place brisket in a large cooking bag and brush ketchup-flour mix over both sides. Press air from bag and tie securely. Place bag containing meat in center of heavy duty foil. (Twice the circumference 8" longer than brisket.) Bring 2 opposite sides of foil together over top of meat. Fold edges over 3 to 4 times pressing crease in tightly each time. Flatten foil at 1 end, crease to create triangle and fold edges over several times toward package, pressing tightly to seal. Repeat procedure on other end. Place in shallow pan and cook in 275 degree oven for 5 hrs. Carefully open foil packet and cooking bag; pour off drippings into saucepan. Add in reserved sauce to drippings and cook slowly, till thoroughly heated. Brush brisket with sauce and place on grill. Cook 10 to 15 min turning and brushing with sauce occasionally. Carve in thin slices diagonally across the grain. (Electric knife works great.) Serve sauce with sliced brisket. Makes 12 to 15 servings. I do not always put on grill.

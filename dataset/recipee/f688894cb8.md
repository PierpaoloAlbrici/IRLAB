[f688894cb8](http://www.food.com/recipe/lime-grapefruit-and-ginger-juice-453698)

### Ingredients

 - 3 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, ginger, ground

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 12 cup of lime juice, raw

 - 1 1/3 cup of grapefruit juice, white, raw

### Instructions

Stir together the sugar, ginger and water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Simmer for 5 minutes, transfer to a glass bowl or cup and put it in the freezer for a few minutes to cool. The original recipe calls for a scant 1/2 cup lime juice but I couldn't get that in the list of ingredients like that. Strain the mixture into a pitcher along with the other juices. Stir and taste for sweetness, add more sugar if you would like. Serve straight in tiny glasses with ice or add to sparkling water as you like it.

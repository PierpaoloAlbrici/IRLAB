In another bowl, combine oats, flour and baking powder, then add to wet ingredients until mixture forms a ball of dough. Knead the dough for a few minutes, adding more flour as necessary if its too sticky. On a floured surface, take half the dough at a time and roll it out into a rectangular shape with about 1/8 thickness. Cut the dough into long strips of about a 3 width. Spread a thin layer of filling down the centre of the strips. Fold the strips over and seal the edges shut. Cut the strips into 3 bars.

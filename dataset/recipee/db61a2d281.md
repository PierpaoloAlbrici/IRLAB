### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of orange juice, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, brown

 - 1 tablespoon of cornstarch

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

 - 2 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

### Instructions

In a small saucepan, whisk together sauce ingredients until blended. Set pan over medium high heat and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. *I use this over boneless, skinless chicken and noodles (rice noodles), but you can use it over pork or salmon as well. *

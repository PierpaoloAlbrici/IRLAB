Cranberry Vinaigrette


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of cranberry juice, unsweetened


 - 13 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1/4 cup of cranberries, dried, sweetened


 - 1 tablespoon of vinegar, balsamic


 - 2 tablespoon of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 1 tablespoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 18 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of fresh red onions, upc: 888670013229


Instructions: 

In a food processor, combine everything except the red onion. Process on low until all of the ingredients have emulsified (turned creamy and even in texture) and the cranberry is broken up into pieces that are about the size of fresh ground pepper. Pour the vinaigrette into a dressing bottle. Add finely minced red onion and lightly shake to combine. Serve immediately or store up to 1 week in the refrigerator. Shake vigorously between uses. Note: Recommended brands are Lakewood Organic and R.W. Knudsen. A cranberry cocktail like Ocean Spray wont work for this recipe as it is less concentrated.

No-Knead Baguette -- Using Recipe #309834


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 cup of alcoholic beverage, beer, regular, all


 - 1 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 tablespoon of vinegar, distilled


 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 6 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 14 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


Instructions: 

Refer to Recipe #309834 for instructions to prepare the dough necessary to make the baguette. Preheat Oven to 450 degrees with a baking stone placed on the middle rack. Place an empty broiler try on any other shelf that won't interfere with the rising bread. With wet hands, pull up one end of the refrigerated dough (Recipe #309834). Using a serrated knife, cut off a 1-pound, or grapefruit-size, piece of dough. Lightly dust the ball of dough with flour and shape into a ball by stretching the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all sides, rotating the ball a quarter-turn as you go. Once it's cohesive, begin to stretch and elongate the dough, dusting with additional flour as necessary. You may find it helpful to roll it back and forth with your hands on a flour-dusted surface. Form a cylinder approximately 2 inches in diameter. If the loaf will not fit on your pizza peel or stone, cut it in half to make two smaller baguettes. Place the loaf/loaves on a pizza peel covered with whole wheat flour (do not use cornmeal as it's flavor is too strong for baguettes) and allow to rest for 20-30 minutes. After the dough has rested, paint water over the surface or the loaf using a pastry brush. Using a serrated bread knife slash the top with longitudinal cuts that move diagonally across the loaf. Slide the loaf directly onto the hot stone. Pour 1 cup of hot tap water into the broiler tray and quickly close the oven door. Bake for about 25 minutes or until deeply browned and makes a hollow sound when 'thumped'. Allow to cool on a rack before cutting.

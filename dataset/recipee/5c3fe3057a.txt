Vickys Chocolate Fudge Brownies, Dairy, Egg & Soy-Free


Ingredients


 - 175 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 195 g of sugars, brown


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 60 g of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


 - 2 teaspoon of vinegar, cider


 - 170 ml of water, bottled, generic


 - 50 ml of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 60 g of avocados, raw, all commercial varieties


 - 90 g of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

My puree of preference is the avocado. The others will impart flavour to the finished brownies while the avocado doesn't Preheat oven to gas 4 / 180C / 350F Combine all dry ingredients seperately from all wet, then pour wet into dry, add choc chips and mix well Grease and flour or line an 11 x 7 tray and pour the mixture in, spreading evenly Bake for 20-25 mins until a skewer inserted near the edge cones out almost dry. Don't overcook or the brownies won't be gooey Cool and slice. Serve as a treat, or warm with ice cream or custard as a pudding. If you're in an even chocolat-ier mood, dip them halfway in melted chocolate for a double choc brownie!

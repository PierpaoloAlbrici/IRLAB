Sugar-Glazed Roasted Carrots


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 pound of carrots, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Put oven rack in the middle position. Preheat to 475 degrees. Heat rimmed baking sheet for 10 minutes. Toss carrots, melted butter, sugar, salt and pepper until thoroughly combined. Remove pan from oven. Please carrots in single layer on it. Roast until they're beginning to brown, about 15 minutes. Remove pan from oven, toss carrots to redistribute and keep roasting until tender and deep amber in color, with some very darkened spots (but not all over)--about 3 minutes.

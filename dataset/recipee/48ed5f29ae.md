### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of potatoes, raw, skin

 - 3 ounce of cheese, cheddar

 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, chili powder

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1/4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1/4 cup of cream, sour, cultured

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 3 tablespoon of onions, spring or scallions (includes tops and bulb), raw

### Instructions

In a large pot, add the potatoes and cover with cold water and bring to a boil. Cook in the boiling water until tender, about 10-15 minutes. Drain the potatoes well. While the potatoes are still hot, place them in a bowl and add the shredded cheese and butter. While the potatoes are cooking, in a small bowl, whisk the ancho chili powder, garlic powder, milk and sour cream. Add the creamy mixture to the hot potatoes and cheese; begin to mash. You may need to add more milk or sour cream, if necessary, to reach desired texture. Add salt, pepper and scallions, and mix well. To serve, mound the potatoes on a bowl or 1.5-quart casserole dish and top with a little shredded cheese and green onion for garnish. This could be made ahead of time and warmed in the oven.

Angel Food Cake


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched


 - 3/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 1/2 cup of egg, white, raw, fresh


 - 1 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 3/4 cup of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 350F. Sift together: 1 cup cake flour, 3/4 cup sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt. In a medium bowl or in a stand mixer with the whip attachment, whisk until frothy: 1 1/2 cups egg whites (about 12 egg whites), at room temperature. Whisk in: 1 tablespoon water, 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, 1 teaspoon cream of tartar. Keep whisking until the foam is very soft, holds a slight shape, and has increased 4 to 5 times in volume. Whisk in: 3/4 cup sugar. Continue whisking until the mixture forms glossy, soft peaks. The mixture should not be stiff or dry. Transfer to a large bowl. Sift a fine layer of the dry ingredients over the whites and fold them in with a rubber spatula, gently and quickly. Continue sifting and folding until all the dry ingredients are incorporated. Pour the batter into an ungreased 10- by 4-inch tube pan with a removable bottom. Smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes. When done the cake should spring back when touched gently. Invert the pan to keep the cake from sticking or deflating. (If the cake pan has legs, turn it over onto them; otherwise invert the tube pan onto the neck of a large bottle.) Cool completely. To remove the cake from the pan, run a knife around the inside of the pan and around the center tube. Gently push up the bottom, using the knife to help guide the cake out, if necessary. Use a sharp serrated knife to cut the cake, dipping the knife into water between cuts to help keep the cake from sticking. Add 1/4 teaspoon orange flower water or rose water to perfume the cake lightly. For a lemon- or orange-flavored cake, add the finely grated zest of 1 lemon or 1 orange.

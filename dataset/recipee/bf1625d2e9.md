### Ingredients

 - 500 g of potatoes, raw, skin

 - 300 g of carrots, raw

 - 100 g of bacon, meatless

 - 50 g of butter, without salt

 - 100 ml of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground

### Instructions

Heat a small skillet over high heat. Add the bacon and saute for 5 minutes until the bacon bits are well colored. Remove from heat and set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and carrots. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes until the potatoes and carrots are well done or even slightly overdone (they will be easier to mash). Drain the vegetables and place them in a salad bowl. Mash the vegetables with a fork, a potato masher or any other manual ustensil. It is important not to use an electric mixer so that the texture remains chunky enough. Add the bacon bits and let the diced pieces of butter melt on top of the mashed vegetables. Add cream and nutmeg. Season with salt and pepper. Toss well and serve.

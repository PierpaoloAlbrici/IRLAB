### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of beverages, carbonated, ginger ale

 - 2 cup of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

 - 1/2 cup of sauce, worcestershire

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 2 pound of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw

### Instructions

Dry the Meat: In a large bowl, combine the ale or lager with the soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce and the cracked black peppercorns. Dry the Meat: Cut the beef into 1/4-inch-thick slices, either with or against the grain. Dry the Meat: Add the beef to the marinade, a few slices at a time, stirring well to coat each slice with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours. Dry the Meat: Preheat the oven to 200. Set a large wire rack on each of 3 large rimmed baking sheets. Remove the beef from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Arrange the beef on the racks, leaving 1/4 inch between slices. Sprinkle with coarsely ground black pepper. Bake for about 4 hours, until the jerky is firm and almost completely dry, but still chewy. Let cool completely on the racks before serving.

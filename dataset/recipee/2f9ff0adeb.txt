Oven Fries


Ingredients


 - 2 pound of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 1/4 cup of oil, canola


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Wash your potatoes and if desired, peel them. Cut your potatoes into equal-sized wedges. I like mine between 1/2 and 3/4-inch thick. This means you will get about 8-10 wedges from each 1/2-pound potato. If youre not cooking them now, place the potato wedges in a bowl full of cold water. If you are cooking them now, dry them off completely with a paper towel or kitchen towel. In a medium-large bowl, use your hands to toss the potatoes with the canola oil, enough to cover every wedge completely. Season with salt. Mix well. Spread out potatoes on an aluminum half-sheet pan, making sure theyre in a single layer. Use 2 pans if you need to. Place in the preheated oven and bake, stirring occasionally, for at least 25 minutes. They should be brown and smell delicious when theyre done. Serve immediately.

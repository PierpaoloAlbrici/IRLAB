Blueberry Drink Syrup for Blueberry Iced Tea


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of blueberries, raw


 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Place blueberries in a saucepan with water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes. Set sieve or colander lined with cheesecloth (I use a thick papertowel) over a bowl and pour in the blueberry mixture. Gently press out the juice with a spoon or by twisting the cheesecloth. Discard the pulp and measure the juice into saucepan. Add 1/2 cup sugar for each cup of juice and cook over medium heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Bring to a boil and cook 2 minutes. Chill and pour into covered jar. Store in refrigerator. Add two tablespoons to each glass of prepared iced tea. Stir well and garnish with a lemon slice.

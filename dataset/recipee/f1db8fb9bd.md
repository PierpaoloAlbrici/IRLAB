### Ingredients

 - 1/2 teaspoon of corn, sweet, white, raw

 - 2 cup of raspberries, raw

 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

### Instructions

Add peppercorns to a small saute pan. Warm over medium heat for 34 minutes or until slightly fragrant. Transfer to a mortar and pestle or food processer and roughly crush. Add raspberries, sugar, salt and pepper to a small saucepan, and warm over medium heat. Stir as sugar dissolves and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook 57 minutes or until berries are broken down and thickened. Transfer to a blender and puree until smooth. Filter through a sieve to remove excess seeds. Enjoy.

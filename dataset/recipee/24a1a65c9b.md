In medium saucepan, mix together first five ingredients. Cook over medium heat until mixture has risen high in the pan and then come down, about 8 minutes. Drop a little bit of the mixture into a small saucer of cold water. If it forms a ball, it is ready for the next step. Or, use a candy thermometer to check mixture for doneness; the thermometer should read 232 degrees. Remove pan from heat. Add marshmallow cream and baking chips, stirring until melted and smooth. Stir in nuts and vanilla. Pour into greased 8-by-8 inch glass or metal pan. Cool on counter for about 30 minutes, then cut into bite-size pieces and serve.

Ingredients


 - 4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 1/4 ounce of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 6 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract


 - 12 gallon of oil, canola


Instructions: 

Add 2 tablespoon of sugar and the yeast to the water. Use a whisk to dissolve the mixture for about 2 minutes. Let the mixture sit for 7 minutes until it starts to bubble. Turn the mixture to a big bowl and add the remaining sugar, salt, and vanilla extract and mix well until dissolved. Sift the 6 cups of flour into the mixture and mix well with a whisk or a wooden spoon. Then you can begin to mix the mixture with your hand until all the bumps are smooth. Mix for about 4 minutes. When the mixture is smooth, cover with seran wrap and leave it at a warm area to rise for about an hour an hour and a half. Heat up the oil in a pot at medium heat for 15 minutes. Make sure that the oil is about 2 inches deep so that the puff puff dont end up being flat. When you are ready to fry the puff puff lower the heat for a minute. The puff puff mixture should be nice and risen. grab small amount fo the mixture with your hand and squeeze small balls through your thumb and index finger. The balls should rise to the top of the oil quickly. Raise the oil temperature so that the balls can brown. You want to cook these balls for about 3 minutes each or maybe 4 minutes so that the inside gets cooked properly. If you dont want to use your hand to make the balls , you can use a small ice cream scoop. Remember to lower the oil temperature between each fry. Also turn them around frequently so they brown all over. Drain them on a paper towel. and leave to cool for 30 minutes before serving. They taste best with coke or sprite or any soda you might have.

Baked Cranberry Oatmeal


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 6 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1 1/2 cup of oats


 - 1 1/2 cup of apples, raw, with skin


 - 34 cup of cranberries, dried, sweetened


 - 34 cup of nuts, pecans


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 350F degrees. Coat a 9 in square pan with nonstick spray. In a large saucepan, bring the milk, brown sugar, margarine, and cinnamon to a boil. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, mix together the oats, chopped apple, cranberries, and nuts; spread evenly into the prepared pan. When the milk mixture begins to boil, pour out evenly over the oatmeal mixture. Bake uncovered for 30-35 minutes, ore until the liquid has been absorbed and the oatmeal is tender. Cut the mixture into 6 servings, scooping each out into a cereal bowl. Garnish with a sliced apple (if desired) and serve with a pitcher of milk.

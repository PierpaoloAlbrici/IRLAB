[e247f350be](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/special-dietary-needs/gluten-free/snickerdoodle-vegan-overnight-oats/)

### Ingredients

 - 2 tablespoon of nuts, almonds

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1 cup of oats

 - 1 cup of beverages, almond milk, unsweetened, shelf stable

 - 2 teaspoon of syrup, maple, canadian

### Instructions

In a medium bowl, using an electric had mixer, beat together the almond butter, coconut sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon (saving the rest for later use) until well combined, and it resembles cookie dough. Divide the dough between two bowls and press it into the bottom. In a large bowl, stir together the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and the oatmeal. Pour in the almond milk and maple syrup and mix well. Divide the oat mixture between bowls and refrigerate overnight. In the morning, mix the dough at the bottom of the bowl around into the oats and devour! Note: I know it seems silly to use a hand mixer for such a small amount, but its really what gives the cookie dough the right texture.

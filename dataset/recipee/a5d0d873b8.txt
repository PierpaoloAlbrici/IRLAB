Buttery Farm Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 14 cup of butter, salted


 - 34 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Combine flour, baking powder& salt. Cut the butter into the flour using 2 knives or a pastry blender, keep cutting until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs. With a fork stir in the milk, very gently, until a soft dough forms. Don't over mix. Place the dough on a baking sheet (jelly roll pan) and with floured hands press it into a 9" x 9" square. Use a spatula or the dull side of a knife and cut the dough into 12 biscuits without actually cutting them apart. Bake in 400F oven for about 15-20 minutes or until they are golden. Transfer to a wire rack& cool for about 10 minutes. Serve with homemade fruit jam or anything else that takes your fancy.

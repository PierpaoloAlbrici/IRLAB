Spiced Autumn Caramel Corn


Ingredients


 - 3-4 quart of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)


 - 1 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 34 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1/8-1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin, raw


 - 1 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 14 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Mist a large bowl with cooking spray, pour in the popcorn and sprinkle the pecan halves across the top. Set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together the baking soda, cayenne pepper and pumpkin pie spice. In a medium saucepan, mix together the sugar, butter, salt and 1/4 cup of water. Cook over high heat without stirring for 10-14 minutes, until the mixture becomes a light golden-yellow caramel. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Next, carefully whisk in the baking-soda mixture. Pour the caramel mixture over the popcorn & quickly toss the caramel and popcorn together until the popcorn is evenly coated. Spread the popcorn onto two large baking sheets, break apart any large clumps, and allow to cool to room temperature.

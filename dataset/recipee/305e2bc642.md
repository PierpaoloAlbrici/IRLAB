### Ingredients

 - 6-8 ounce of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw

 - 12 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

 - 12 cup of tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average

 - 2 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Rehydrate sun dried tomatoes in a bowl of water 1-2 hours before starting recipe. Or, you can buy sundried tomatoes in oil to skip this step. Cook rice according to package directions, without adding fat or salt. Meanwhile, season both sides of chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook 1 minute per side, until golden brown and seared. Using tongs, remove chicken from pan; set aside. Add canned tomato mix to pan; simmer 1 minute, stirring constantly and incorporating any brown bits from bottom of pan. Stir in sun-dried tomato and artichokes. Return chicken to pan. Cover; simmer 5-10 minutes, until chicken is cooked through. Serve chicken and sauce on cooked rice.

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1/2 cup of nuts, walnuts, english

 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

In a pre-heated saucepan put ur butter & sugar on low to med heat. Stir this mixture for 10 to 13 min, until a golden light brown color. The mixture will start to look stringy when ready. (I have no idea what the temp is suppose to read on thermometer) Just to make sure it's ready to pour, at this stage I will drop a little of the mixture into ice cold water and taste to feel the texture. The chewy texture in the middle needs to be gone. It needs to b crunchy. Remember to keep stirring!!! Also do not burn or scorch the mixture When ready pour mixture onto a cookie sheet covered with foil & spread to about 1/4 inch thick If u would like to add choc & nuts do this now. Start by pouring choc on, let it sit for a few sec to melt. then spread evenly over candy. While choc is still wet sprinkle on the nuts. Apply a little pressure on top to help nuts stick into the choc when it's dry. Let it chill for a few min the u can stick it in the fridge for 5 or 10 min. Then Crack it up and enjoy : )

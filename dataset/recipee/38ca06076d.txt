Homemade pizza dough


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 1/3 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, oregano, dried


 - 2 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 5 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Mix warm water and active dry yeast. Mix flour, olive oil, garlic salt, sugar and oregano, after 2 minutes add the water with the yeast. Once you finish molding the dough, add the butter and keep molding probably you will need to add more flour. Let the dough rest for at least 2 hours, this step makes the dough grow and eventually add a better flavor. Usually I bake my pizza at 450 for 20-25 minutes, it's delicious!

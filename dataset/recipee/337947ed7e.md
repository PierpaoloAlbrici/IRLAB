### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of oil, canola

 - 2 cup of shallots, raw

### Instructions

In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, heat oil until it registers 275 degrees on a deep-frying thermometer. Add shallots and cook, stirring, until light golden brown, about 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer shallots to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain. Increase heat to high and place a fine-mesh sieve over a heatproof bowl. When oil reaches 350 degrees on the thermometer, add the fried shallots and cook just until they are crisp and well-browned, a few seconds, watching carefully so they do not burn. Immediately pour oil and shallots through sieve to stop cooking, then transfer shallots to paper-towel-lined plate to drain. Reserve oil for another use. Shallots will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for 1 day.

Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line muffin cups with paper liners. Whisk almond milk and vinegar together in a small bowl; set aside until curdled, about 10 minutes. Mix whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl. Combine carrots, pineapple, raisins, and walnuts together in a separate bowl. Whisk 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons white sugar, olive oil, molasses, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and cardamom together in a separate bowl. Mix curdled milk mixture and sugar mixture into flour mixture just until batter is mixed; fold in carrot mixture. Spoon batter into muffin cups until each is completely filled and domed. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.

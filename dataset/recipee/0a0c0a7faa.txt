Nancy's Turkey Stuffing


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of onions, raw


 - 12 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 1 1/2 cup of celery, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, thyme, dried


Instructions: 

Melt the butter in a large, heavy skillet. Add the onion and cook until yellow. Stir in as many breadcrumbs as fit and heat. Transfer to a large, deep bowl and add celery, seasoning and the rest of the bread. Mix well. If too dry, add enough broth or water to moisten (don't make it soggy! ).

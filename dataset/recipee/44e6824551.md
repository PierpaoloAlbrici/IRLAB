### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow

 - 12 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 13 cup of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Cut butter or margerine into dry ingredients. Mix well. Store in a ziploc bag in the fridge or freezer until ready to use. Excellent for camping. Great for breading fish. For Bun-on-a-stick; 1 cup mix and 1/4 c water or milk. Mix until just combined. Peel sticks, wrap small amount of dough around the peeled stick. Roast in campfire. Add butter, jam &/or maple syrup. For pancakes: 1 c mix & 2/3 c water or milk. Stir until moistened. Cook on a well-seasoned cast iron pan or griddle. Makes excellent pancakes. * Take out the sugar is you want them less sweet & more savoury. ** More than a delicious substitute for pancakes & biscuits, bun-on-a-stick is a recipe for memories. Eating it takes me back to reunions past when Auntie Amy (your great Nana Liam), Auntie Marlene, & Auntie Cheryl would prepare this for all the kids. Watching it cook on our freshly peeled sticks fed our imaginations & created heartfelt memories that will last a lifetime.

English Toffee with Almonds


Ingredients


 - 23 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

First, generously spray a cookie sheet with nonstick spray, set aside. Process the almonds to a medium crush for topping, set aside. In a medium saucepan, combine butter, sugar and water. Cook and occasionally stir over medium heat to 300 degrees F. This should take about 25 minutes or so. Use a candy thermometer! (Note: Be careful not to leave the stove after the candy reaches 250 degrees F or so; it comes to hard crack stage very quickly and can burn in a heartbeat!) As soon as the candy reaches the hard crack stage, pour the molten toffee onto the greased cookie sheet. It should level out to a nice thickness on its own but you can shimmy the pan back and forth to level it more. When the hot toffee gets a firm skin starting to cool on top, sprinkle the chocolate chips. Let the chips soften on the hot toffee and spread them with a spatula to cover. Immediately sprinkle the crushed almonds on the wet chocolate. Chill and break into manageable pieces. Enjoy mes amis!

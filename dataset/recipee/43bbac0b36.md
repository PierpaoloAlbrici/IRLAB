### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of oats

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 13 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1 3/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

Coarsely chop the oats in a food processor and transfer to a large bowl. Pulse together the flour, butter, brown sugar, baking powder and salt in the food processor until mixture resembles a coarse meal. Add milk and blend until mixture just forms a dough. Add the oats and knead until just incorporated. Halve the dough and pat each half into a 5 by 3-inch rectangle. Chill, wrapped well in plastic wrap, until firm, about 3 hours. Preheat the oven to 350F. Cut 1 rectangle cross-wise into scant 1/4 inch thick slices and bake on an ungreased large baking sheet in the middle of the oven until undersides are a shade darker, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool and make more biscuits with the remaining rectangle of dough.

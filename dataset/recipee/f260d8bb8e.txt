Honey & Nut Cheerios Squares


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of honey


 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 12 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 5 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Measure honey and sugar into a large saucepan. Heat just to boiling. Add peanut butter and stir until melted. Remove from heat and stir in Cheerios, mixing thoroughly to coat evenly. Fold into a buttered 13x9 pan. Allow to cool one minute. With slightly wet hands, gently press mixture down so that bars will be compact and hold their shape. Allow to cool thoroughly, about 15 minutes. Cut into squares.

Large Quantity Pate Brisee


Ingredients


 - 3 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 1/2 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1/2 to 3/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Place the flour, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor, and process for a few seconds to combine. Add the butter pieces to the flour mixture, and process until the mixture resembles coarse meal, about 10 seconds. Add the ice water in a slow, steady stream, through the feed tube with the machine running, just until the dough holds together. Do not process for more than 30 seconds. Turn the dough out onto a work surface. Divide into 2 equal pieces, and place on 2 separate sheets of plastic wrap. Flatten, and form 2 disks. Wrap, and refrigerate at least 1 hour before using.

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of nuts, cashew nuts, raw

 - 1/4 cup of syrup, maple, canadian

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, cumin seed

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper. One sheet will be used to roast the cashews, the other will be used for cooling the cashews. Preheat oven to 350. In a medium sized bowl, combine cashews, maple syrup, spices and 1 teaspoon of salt. Stir and then spread the cashews onto one baking sheet. Roast for 20 minutes. The syrup will turn the cashews a dark caramel color. Remove the nuts from the hot cookie sheet onto the second cool cookie sheet, being careful to separate the cashews. Sprinkle with additional salt (to taste). Serve when cool, at least 5 minutes.

Cheesecake-Stuffed Strawberries


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of strawberries, raw


 - 8 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 1 tablespoon of cream, sour, cultured


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, powdered


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Combine all ingredients (except berries) in a large bowl, and blend together using a hand mixer. Ingredients at room temperature blend better. I actually mixed mine by hand but had to stir quite a bit. Its amazing what Ill do to get out of washing extra dishes! Using a paring knife, cut a circle around the top/stem of the strawberry and scoop out the middle. I also cut a sliver off the bottom of each berry, so they would stand up on the platter. Just dont cut all the way through! Place the cheesecake filling in a piping bag and squeeze it to fill up the holes in the tops of the berries. Set the filled berries on a platter. Sprinkle graham cracker crumbs on top and serve! Tip: You should be fine to hollow out your strawberries ahead of time (I did it a few days prior). However, I wouldnt suggest filling them more than about 5 hours ahead of time (unless youre planning on freezing them). Otherwise they could get a little soggy.

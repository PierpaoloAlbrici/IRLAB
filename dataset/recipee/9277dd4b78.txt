Baked Vanilla Salt Tofu (Vegan)


Ingredients


 - 16 ounce of tofu, raw, regular, prepared with calcium sulfate


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, canola


 - 1 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 12 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Dry out the tofu thoroughly either by the press method or microwave method. Cut into slices, one brick gives you about 8-10. Mix the other ingredients together in a small bowl to make a marinade. Lay out the tofu slices in a baking dish (like 11 x 7 or 9 x13) and with a pastry or BBQ brush, brush the slices evenly with the marinade, on each side. There should be some marinade left-- evenly pour it over the tofu slices and throughout the bottom of the baking dish. Bake at 400F for 20 minutes, then flip the slices over to bake again for another 20 minutes.

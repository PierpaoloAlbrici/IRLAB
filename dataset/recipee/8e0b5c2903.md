### Ingredients

 - 12 pound of shallots, raw

 - 2 1/2 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Place shallots and oil in a bread loaf pan. You may need to add more oil to cover all the shallots. Make sure they are all covered. Cook in a 250F oven until the shallots are soft and have turned a little brown. Remove shallots from oil and set aside, uncovered in the fridge to cool completely before you cover them. Pour oil through a coffee filter and let cool in the fridge before you bottle it. Keep chilled. I don't know how long it will actually last before going bad, because it only lasts about 2 weeks in my house. BE ADVISED! SOME LOCAL HEATH DEPARTMENTS CLAIM THAT THERE IS A RISK WHEN MAKING HOMEMADE FLAVORED OILS. To help avoid any risk of illness I suggest that you treat this entire procedure like you are doing home canning. SANITIZE EVERYTHING THAT WILL COME INCONTACT WITH FOOD! I can't stress this enough. Botulism is nothing to mess around with. I have never had a problem with my flavored oils. Always smell them before you use them. If there is any doubt about the quality, TOSS IT! You can't be too careful. Be careful and enjoy.

Christmas Fudge


Ingredients


 - 2 pound of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 12 pint of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 1 cup of nuts, walnuts, english


Instructions: 

Slowly melt chocolate in a double boiler; simmer over low heat. When the chocolate has completely melted, whip the whipping cream on the highest speed of your hand-held mixer, (for about 3 minutes) or until it has thickened. Stir the whipped cream into the melted chocolate, until it has completely dissolved (continuously stirring for about 3 minutes). The fudge will become dark in color and glossy. Stir in the chopped walnuts, then pour into a buttered 13x9x2-inch pan. Refrigerate until slightly firm. With a buttered knife, cut into 48 square pieces. Refrigerate again, until fudge has firmed up completely. *Note: Ambrosia Real Milk Chocolate is a good quality brand of chocolate that I use to make this fudge. One other thing I wanted to mention. When I made this fudge, I stated to use a double boiler, but years ago I didn't own one, so I used an oversized waterless cookware pot (to heat/simmer the water in). I melted the chocolate in a large size aluminum bowl, which I placed that over the large pot of simmering 'hot' water. Also, you can place this fudge in the freezer, as it does freeze well.

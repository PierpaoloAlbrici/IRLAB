### Ingredients

 - 14 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 13 cup of lemon juice, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, thyme, dried

 - 1 tablespoon of parsley, fresh

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, rosemary, dried

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Seasoning -- Just mix in all in a large baggie, toss well and add the chicken. Any type of chicken will work, boneless skinless, thighs, wings, drumettes, bone in breasts, even quarters. Also pork chops, tenderloins, or just even cubes of chicken or pork for kabobs. Of course cubes or thinner cuts will take shorter to marinade, whereas -- larger cuts such as bone in breasts will take longer to marinate. Just enjoy, it is just a nice fresh taste and works great.

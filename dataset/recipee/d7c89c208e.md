### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 5 1/2 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/4 cup of egg, white, raw, fresh

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

 - 3/4 cup of nuts, almonds

### Instructions

Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat the oven to 400F (200C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. (I dont recommend using silicone baking mats for this recipe as the croquants wont be as crisp.) In a medium bowl, mix together the sugar and flour, then stir in the egg whites and salt until smooth. Stir in the almonds or hazelnuts. Drop level teaspoons of batter at least 2 inches (5 cm) apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake, rotating the baking sheets midway during baking, until the cookies are toasty brown in color, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets. The batter can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 1 month. Let it come to room temperature before spooning and baking. Store the baked croquants in an airtight container for up to 5 days. For this recipe, the almonds or hazelnuts should be very coarsely choppedbasically cut into rough halves or thirds.

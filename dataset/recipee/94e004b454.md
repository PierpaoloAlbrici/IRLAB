[94e004b454](http://www.food.com/recipe/best-cinnamon-y-buttery-syrup-sauce-331388)

### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of butter, salted

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

 - 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 tablespoon of syrups, corn, light

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

### Instructions

Bring butter, sugar, buttermilk, vanilla extract, corn syrup, and cinnamon to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Once simmering, whisk in baking soda, and cook for 10 seconds before removing from heat. Serve warm. After adding the baking soda this looks quite frothy--but after you take it off the heat, keep whisking, and then let it sit for a minute, then whisk it again, and it will become the right consistency.

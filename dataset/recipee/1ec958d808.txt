Chorizo Meatballs


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of pork, fresh, loin, tenderloin, separable lean only, raw


 - 5 ounce of pork sausage, link/patty, unprepared


 - 1 tablespoon of vinegar, cider


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, paprika


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 425. Mix all ingredients in a bowl. The chorizo will not crumble like the ground pork. So you'll want to tear it into smaller chunks so it blends well with the other ingredients. Form mixture into 16 to 20 balls. Place in a stoneware or glass baking dish. Bake 20-25 minutes.

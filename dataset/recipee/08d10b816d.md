### Ingredients

 - 1 liter of beverages, almond milk, unsweetened, shelf stable

 - 1 liter of water, bottled, generic

 - 150 g of cornstarch

 - 80 g of rice flour, white, unenriched

 - 500 g of sugars, granulated

 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 cup of nuts, pistachio nuts, raw

### Instructions

Place cold water in a large bowl and add the cornstarch. Stir well until the cornstarch is completely dissolved (there should be no lumps as long as you do this in cold water). Place the almond milk and rice flour in a saucepan and stir well to dissolve. Add the cornstarch and place the saucepan over a low heat. Stir continuously while the liquid heats up and bring it to a simmer. Stir continuously! Simmer for about 10 minutes or until it becomes the consistency of thick custard (stirring continuously! ). Pour into a large wide rectangular dish (like a big lasagne dish) and smooth the surface out level. Allow to cool. Refrigerate for a couple of hours and then cut into diamond shaped slices in the pan. Spread the crushed pistachios over the top and serve.

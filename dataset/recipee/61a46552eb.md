### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 23 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 3 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 13 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

### Instructions

In a large mixing bow, add melted butter and then stir in cocoa at low speed. Alternately add powdered sugar and milk, beating to spreading consistency (This may take some time in the mixer as ours is always lumpy for a while). Stir in vanilla. Add small amount additional milk, if needed to spread easily. We like it to pour on like a ganache!

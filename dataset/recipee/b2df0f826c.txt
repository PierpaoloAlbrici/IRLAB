Quick Herb Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 5 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 tablespoon of parsley, fresh


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, thyme, dried


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and grease a cookie sheet. Mash the butter, parsley and thyme together. Put the flour, baking powder and salt into a food processor or large mixing bowl. If using a food processor, turn it on and drop the butter in 4 to 5 dollops into the machine while it's running. If working by hand, rub the butter into the flour until it looks like bread crumbs. Pour in the buttermilk or milk-vinegar mixture and process or stir until you have a soft ball. Drop in roughly formed pieces onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake 12 to 15 minutes.

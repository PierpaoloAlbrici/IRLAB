Easy and Pretty Blueberry Jam


Ingredients


 - 200 g of blueberries, raw


 - 60 to 65 g of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

Coat the blueberries in half the amount of sugar (30 g) and let sit for over 20 minutes. Add lemon juice, set on medium heat, and stir with a wooden spatula while it simmers. When it starts to thicken, add the rest of the sugar, and continue to stir while it simmers until right before it reaches the desired consistency. Fill the jar while it is still hot, seal the lid tightly, then turn the jar upside down until it cools.

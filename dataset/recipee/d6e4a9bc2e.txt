Yogurt Berry Parfaits


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


 - 1 cup of vanilla extract


 - 34 cup of oats


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1 cup of raspberries, raw


 - 1 cup of strawberries, raw


 - 1 cup of blueberries, raw


Instructions: 

In a small bowl, stir together the yogurt and vanilla pudding. Set aside. Heat a dry skillet over medium heat. Pour in the oats, and toast for about 1 minute, or until hot. Drizzle honey and sprinkle the cinnamon over the oats and continue to stir over medium heat until the oats are crispy and aromatic. Remove the oats from the heat, and spoon most of them into the bottom of 4 glasses or small bowls. Reserve the rest for topping. Using about half of the fruit, place a layer of fruit over the oats in each glass. Pour the yogurt pudding mixture over the fruit. Top with the rest of the fruit, and sprinkle with the rest of the toasted oats.

Make it don't buy it: toffee popcorn


Ingredients


 - 100 g of corn, sweet, white, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 40 g of sugars, brown


 - 4 tablespoon of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 30 g of butter, without salt


 - 1 teaspoon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Heat the oil in a large, heavy-based pan over a medium heat. Add the butter and melt, swirling into the oil with a wooden spoon. Pour in the corn and add a pinch of salt. Put the lid on the pan. The corn will start popping after about 1 minute and carry on for another 2-3 minutes. When the popping sounds slow down to more than 4 or 5 seconds between pops, remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly in the pan. Meanwhile, add the butter, syrup, sugar and water to a saucepan over a medium-high heat. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon until the butter has melted and sugar dissolved. Bring to the boil and let it bubble rapidly for 4-5 minutes, stirring throughout, until the mixture is a dark, toffee colour. Pour the toffee sauce over the popcorn, and stir to coat all the kernels. Leave to cool slightly and let the toffee sauce harden for around 5 minutes before serving.

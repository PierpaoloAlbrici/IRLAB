 - 2 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 1/2 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt

 - 1/4 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

 - 1 1/2 cup of noodles, egg, dry, unenriched

### Instructions

Melt 1 cup of chocolate chips in a heavy saucepan over low heat. Mix in the cereal and the coconut. Drop teaspoonfuls of the mixture onto waxed paper for the spiders' bodies. Melt the second cup of chocolate chips. Gently stir in chow mein noodles. When chocolate is cooled, pick noodles out one by one and attach them to the spider bodies for legs (8 to a spider). Add dots of frosting for eyes, if desired. Leftover chocolate noodles can be made into more spider cookies.

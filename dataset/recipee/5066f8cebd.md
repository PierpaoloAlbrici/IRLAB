### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of nuts, cashew nuts, raw

 - 12-34 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 14 cup of sweetener, syrup, agave

 - 12 teaspoon of beans, snap, green, raw

### Instructions

Put all of the ingredients in a food processor with an S blade and blend until the cashew consistency resembles whipped cream. (It will continue to solidify the longer you run the machine.) It's also better if you stick in the refrigerator for about 20 or 30 minutes.

Deep Fried Turkey injection - butter creole


Ingredients


 - 2 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, onion powder


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Melt butter slowly as not to burn. Add rest of ingredients and mix well. (I place in a covered bowl and shake vigorously). Inject into your turkey and allow to sit for one hour or more before deep frying. HINT: We were cooking the turkey while camping, and decided to leave it in the bag to inject it, so it would not be so messy! It worked great!

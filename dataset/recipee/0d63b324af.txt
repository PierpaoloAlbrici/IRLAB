Hgs Rockin' Poppin' Shrimp - Ww Points = 3


Ingredients


 - 3 ounce of crustaceans, shrimp, raw (not previously frozen)


 - 14 cup of egg substitute, powder


 - 12 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt


 - 1 dash of salt, table


 - 1 dash of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Pour Egg Beaters into a bowl. Using a blender or food processor, grind Fiber One cereal to a breadcrumb-like consistency. Pour Fiber One crumbs into a plastic container that has an airtight lid (or into a plastic food storage bag). Add as much salt & pepper to Fiber One as you like. Next, prepare the shrimp by ensuring that they are as dry as possible (use a paper towel to soak up moisture). Place shrimp in dish with Egg Beaters and coat them thoroughly. Transfer shrimp to Fiber One container or bag and secure lid/seal bag. Then shake until shrimp are well coated. Place shrimp on a baking dish sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Cook shrimp for 15 20 minutes (flipping them about halfway through), until outsides are crispy. Let em cool; then serve 'em alone, with ketchup or with some cocktail sauce.

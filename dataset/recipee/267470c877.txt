Quick Boiled Soybeans in a Pressure Cooker


Ingredients


 - 150 g of beans, snap, green, raw


 - 600 ml of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Boil the beans in plenty of water for 1 hour (alternatively, you can use boiled water). Drain the soy beans in a colander. Put the beans and 600 ml water in a pressure cooker, cover with an 'otoshibuta' (drop lid) and cook. If you don't have one, you can use one made from parchment paper. Once the pressure gauge has risen and the pot is steaming, cook for 5 minutes on low heat. Once the heat has dissipated, you can immediately use the soybeans in other dishes. Use the boiled water: To make a soup, use 600 ml of the boiled water, add consomme soup stock and usukuchi soy sauce (2 teaspoons each), salt and pepper to taste, and then a generous amount of vegetables!

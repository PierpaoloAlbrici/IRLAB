Strawberry Lemonade Concentrate


Ingredients


 - 6 cup of strawberries, raw


 - 4 cup of lemon juice, raw


 - 6 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 14 quart of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Prepare water bath canner. Sterilize jars & lids for 7 pint jars. Hull & slice strawberries, about 3 lbs. Place lemon juice & sugar into large pot. Add strawberries to pot, stir to combine. Turn heat to medium high, continue stirring occasionally. Let juice/sugar/strawberry combination come to 190 degrees (do not let boil). Add mixture to jars by ladling strawberries into each jar & then adding liquid to within 1/4" of jar top. Wipe jar tops with damp cloth to ensure there are no drips to prevent a good seal. Add jar lids & rings. Process for 15 minutes in boiling water. Remove from canning pot & let cool, untouched, overnight. To serve mix 1 pint concentrate with 2 quarts water, lemon-lime soda, ginger-ale, or soda water. To store, remove rings & place in a cool, dry, dark (like a pantry) location.

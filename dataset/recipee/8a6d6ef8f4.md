### Ingredients

 - 3/4 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1 1/2 cup of nuts, pecans

### Instructions

This is an easy yet elegant butter-pecan cookie shaped to resemble an acorn and dipped in melted chocolate chips and chopped pecans. Preheat oven to 375F (190C). In a large bowl, beat together butter, brown sugar, 3/4 cup chopped pecans and vanilla on medium speed until well blended. Add flour and baking powder and mix well, using low speed. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Slightly flatten by pressing balls onto un-greased cookie sheets; pinch tops to point to resemble acorns. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes at 375F (190C). Remove from oven and cool on wire racks. In top of a double boiler over simmering water, melt chocolate chips, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat; keep double boiler over water. Dip large ends of cooled cookies into melted chocolate, then roll in chopped pecans. Cool to set chocolate. Yield: 3 dozen.

Nutty English Toffee


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of nuts, walnuts, english


 - 1 pound of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

Generously grease an extra-large (or two medium) cookie sheet(s) with butter. Chop nuts and spread them in an even layer over the cookie sheet(s). Set the cookie sheet(s) off to the side. Cut the pound of butter (4 sticks) into sections and dump it, along with the pound of sugar into a large pot. Insert a candy thermometer into the pot clipping it onto the side. Make sure that the thermometer is not touching the bottom of the pot, but rather just resting in the liquid. Bring the butter and sugar to a slow, rolling boil over medium heat. Boil over medium heat stirring constantly until the mixture reaches between 295 and 300 F on the thermometer. As soon as it hits that temperature, stop stirring and let it boil to 305 F. The concoction should be about the color of caramel, or a little lighter. When it hits 305 F, immediately remove the boiling butter and sugar from the heat and pour in the vanilla (have this already measured out). Pour the liquid toffee mixture into the pre-greased cookie sheet(s) spreading the mixture evenly over the nuts with a rubber spatula. Let it sit for a few minutes and then sprinkle the chocolate chips over the top. With your rubber spatula, spread the chocolate into an even layer over the toffee. Place it in the fridge for a bit, then in the freezer for a few hours to speed up the hardening of the chocolate. When the chocolate has completely set and hardened, take it out of the freezer, turn it upside down onto the counter or a cutting board and give it a few whacks with the side of a wooden spoon to break it up into bite sized pieces. Store leftovers in an airtight container.

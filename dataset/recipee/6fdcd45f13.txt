A Fine Marmalade of Cherries


Ingredients


 - 3 pound of cherries, sweet, raw


 - 1 cup of raspberries, raw


 - 2 cup of currants, zante, dried


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Put all the ingredients together into an enameled, tinned or stainless steel pan; boil them over high heat, skimming off any scum that rises. When you find them of a fit consistency, with a fine clear jelly mingled with the cherries, take them from the heat, and bruise the cherries with the back of your spoon. Put them in hot jars. The marmalade should be then processed. The Magic Ring For The Needy& Greedy. Moira Meighn.

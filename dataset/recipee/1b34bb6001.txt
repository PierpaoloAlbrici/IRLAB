Pop Drops


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)


 - 1 cup of oil, corn, peanut, and olive


 - 12 cup of raisins, seeded


 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

In a mixing bowl, combine all ingredients EXCEPT the chocolate chips. In a double boiler, melt the chocolate chips; then slowly pour the melted chocolate over the popcorn mixture in the mixing bowl. Stir the popcorn mixture carefully until the chocolate has been distributed evenly in it. Now drop the mixture by spoonfuls onto a wax paper lined cookie sheet. When it has cooled completely, store in a tightly closed container. Suggestions: Swap out the peanuts for another kind of nut (like almonds or macadamia); swap out the chocolate chips for butterscotch, peanut butter or mint chocolate chips.

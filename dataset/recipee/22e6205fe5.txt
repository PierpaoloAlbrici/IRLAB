Mama's Blackberry Cobbler


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3/4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 2 cup of blackberries, raw


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour the melted butter into the bottom of an 8x8-inch square baking pan.

Bake in the preheated oven until the top is browned and the cobbler is bubbling, about 45 minutes.

Pepita Quinoa Chia Bread


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of quinoa, uncooked


 - 1/4 cup of seeds, chia seeds, dried


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of vinegar, cider


 - 1/2 cup of seeds, pumpkin and squash seeds, whole, roasted, without salt


Instructions: 

Note: Start the recipe the night before. Soak quinoa in cold water and leave in the refrigerator overnight. (The amount of water does not matter because it will be drained. Just make sure all the quinoa is completely immersed.) Put chia seeds in 1/2 cup of water and stir. Leave this to soak in the refrigerator overnight as well. (It will turn into a thick gel.) Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a foil loaf pan (measuring approximately 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 x 2 1/2) liberally with olive oil cooking spray. Drain the quinoa well and place it in a food processor. Add chia gel, remaining 1/2 cup water, olive oil, baking soda, salt, and apple cider vinegar. Process for 3 minutes. (The mix will be a thick batter with some of the quinoa and chia seeds still visible.) Pour batter into the foil loaf pan and sprinkle pepitas evenly over the top. Sprinkle a pinch of salt on top of the pepitas if desired. Bake on the bottom rack of the oven for 90 minutes. Let cool for at least 30 minutes before removing from the pan and cutting into slices.

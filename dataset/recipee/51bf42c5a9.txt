Healthy Frozen Fruit Smoothie


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


 - 1 1/2 cup of pineapple, raw, all varieties


 - 1 scoop of beverages, protein powder whey based


 - 1 tablespoon of seeds, flaxseed


 - 8 drop of sweetener, herbal extract powder from stevia leaf


Instructions: 

Put yogurt and frozen fruit in a blender. Blend on "ice crush" until the fruit is broken up, and continue to blend on medium speed until smooth. You can skip "ice crush" if it's not an option on your blender. You may need to add yogurt and stir occasionally to get the mixture to blend. Add Protein Powder, Stevia and Flax Seed Meal. Good fruit combinations include: banana-raspberry-pineapple; banana-strawberry-mango; bananas-blueberry-raspberry (high fiber). Notes:. You can buy most frozen fruit, but not bananas. Peel them and break them in thirds or quarters by hand, and put in a freezer bag. Don't slice them into small pieces or else they will stick together. I recommend peeling and cutting up ripe mangoes instead of buying them frozen. Be sure to break them apart in the freezer bag a few hours after putting them in the freezer. This recipe is low-sugar because of the Stevia and the plain yogurt. If you're not concerned about sugar, you can use flavored yogurt and/or honey in place of Stevia. Flax seed meal adds fiber and Omega-3 fatty acids. Be sure to use Flax Seed Meal or "Milled" Flax seeds. Not "Ground" Flax seeds.

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of cranberries, dried, sweetened

 - 12 cup of pears, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

 - 1 tablespoon of currants, zante, dried

 - 14 teaspoon of pumpkin, raw

 - 3 tablespoon of cranberry juice, unsweetened

 - 2 tablespoon of vinegar, red wine

 - 2 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 15 ounce of cheese, brie

### Instructions

Combine everything except the brie in a heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium high heat. Cover, reduce heat and simmer 30 mins, stirring frequently. Uncover and cook 5 more minutes, or till slightly thickened. Cool to room temperature. Cut a circle in the top rind of the brie, leaving a 1/4" border. Carefully remove center circle of rind from cheese, leaving border intact. Place the brie in a pretty pie plate or on a small ovenproof platter. Spread cranberry mixture over top. Bake at 350 degrees for 12-15 mins, or just till cheese is bubbly. Serve immediately with french bread, crackers, or slices of apple or pear.

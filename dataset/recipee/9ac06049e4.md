### Ingredients

 - 1 1/2 pound of brussels sprouts, raw

 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 18 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 dash of spices, nutmeg, ground

### Instructions

Trim the base of the sprouts & discard the tough outer leaves, then rinse well. Steam sprouts for 10 to 12 minutes or until just tender, then rinse them briefly under cold running water. In a large skillet over high heat, melt the butter & cook it carefully until it turns a nut-brown color, but watch carefully to prevent the butter form burning. Add the sprouts & saute quickly to brown them on all sides. Season with salt, pepper & nutmeg & serve immediately.

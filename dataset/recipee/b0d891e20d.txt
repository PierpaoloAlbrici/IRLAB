Peanut and Sultana Slice (Or Peanut & Golden Raisin Bar)


Ingredients


 - 185 g of butter, without salt


 - 12 cup of sugars, powdered


 - 12 cup of raisins, seeded


 - 1 cup of oil, corn, peanut, and olive


 - 1 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


Instructions: 

Pre-heat oven to 180 deg Celsius. Grease a slice pan 19cm x 29cm. Gently melt the butter in a saucepan large enough to mix all ingredients. Add sugar, sultanas, peanuts and coconut and give a quick stir. Now add sifted flour. Firmly press this mix into prepared pan. I prefer to use my hands. Bake for 30 mins, or until golden. Cool in pan, not cutting until completely cold, ideally the next day.

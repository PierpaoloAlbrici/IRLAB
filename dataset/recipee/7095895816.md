### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 1/2 tablespoon of cheese, parmesan, hard

### Instructions

Place all ingredients in order in your bread machine using the regular bread cycle. If you want pizza dough, use the"dough" setting and roll out flat on a floured surface. Preheat your oven to 400. Spray your cooking pan with Pam. You can also sprinkle a little cornmeal on the pan if you wish. Lay dough out on your pan and cover with cling film OR apply a little extra olive oil over the surface of the dough. Let rise for 1/2 hour. Bake for 15-20 minutes. Remove from oven, apply toppings and continue baking until toppings are done. If you wish to make a freeform loaf: Preheat oven to 350F. Form loaf on a prepared baking sheet, cover with cling and let rise until doubled. Bake until golden brown and sounds hollow when thumped (about 30 minutes). Remove to a cooling rack and lightly coat with butter while still hot for a tender crust.

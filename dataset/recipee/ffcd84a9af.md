### Ingredients

 - 1 1/2 pound of grapes, red or green (european type, such as thompson seedless), raw

 - 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2/3 cup of syrup, maple, canadian

 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

### Instructions

Prepare an ice-water bath; set aside. Combine the grapes and the water in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat until the liquid begins to bubble and the grapes start releasing liquid, about 4 minutes. Reduce heat, and simmer until the juices are dark purple and the grapes begin to break apart, about 3 minutes. Pass the mixture through a food mill and then through a fine sieve into a large bowl set in the ice bath; stir frequently until completely cool. Stir in the simple syrup and lemon juice. Transfer the mixture to an ice-cream maker, and freeze according to manufacturers instructions. Transfer to an airtight container, and store in the freezer until ready to serve, up to 2 weeks.

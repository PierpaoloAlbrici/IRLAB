### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of peaches, yellow, raw

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 3 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 2 tablespoon of cornstarch

### Instructions

Line a 9 x 13 greased pan with sliced peaches (see note below). Put the water in a sauce pan and bring to a slow boil. Cream together 1 1/2 cups sugar and butter. Sift dry ingredients in a separate bowl. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt with the sugar and butter, alternating with milk. Spread the batter evenly over the peaches. Combine the remaining 2 cups sugar and cornstarch, and sprinkle over the cake batter. Pour boiling water over all. Bake for 1 hour at 350 degress. Notes: If your fresh peaches are not overly sweet, sprinkle 1/2 cup of sugar over the peaches. Its okay to not put on the entire 1 3/4 cups boiling water as the peaches will create some juice. If you use the entire 1 3/4 cups water, please line your oven as this dish will boil over! You can use frozen/thawed peaches, but make sure to decrease the boiling water needed at the end to 1 1/4 cups.

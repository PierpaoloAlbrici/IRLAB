### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of asparagus, raw

 - 1 teaspoon of oil, sesame, salad or cooking

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Rinse asparagus and pat dry. Place on jelly roll pan or a pan with sides. Drizzle sesame oil onto asparagus, tossing to coat, then sprinkle with kosher salt. Roast for 10 - 15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the asparagus. I like the ends to be a little crispy.

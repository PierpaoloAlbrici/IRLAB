Oven-Roasted Chestnuts Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of nuts, chestnuts, european, dried, peeled


 - 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Heat the oven to 475 degrees F. Using a sharp knife, cut an X about 1 inch long through the shell on the flat side of each chestnut. Measure out about 2 feet of aluminum foil and set it over a baking sheet. Place the chestnuts in the middle of the foil in a single layer. Bring the shorter sides of the foil up so they kiss. Crimp the longer sides over to create a seal. Leave a 1-inch hole at the top to create a vent. Pour the water into the vent and cook the foil pouch in the oven for 5 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 375 degrees F, carefully pull the foil down all the way to expose the chestnuts, and continue to cook until tender, about 25 minutes more. Peel when cool enough to handle.

Sweet and Salty Kettle Corn (Rachael Ray)


Ingredients


 - 14 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 12 cup of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)


 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

In a large pot with a tight-fitting lid, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the popcorn. When the oil sizzles, sprinkle the sugar over the kernels. Cover and shake the pan until the popping slows down, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and toss with the salt.

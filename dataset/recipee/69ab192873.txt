Instructions: 

In a large bowl, mix buttermilk, shallots, garlic, salt, sugar, cumin and pepper. Rinse chicken parts and pat dry; trim off excess fat and submerge chicken into buttermilk brine; cover and chill for at least 4 hours or up to 1 day. Lift chicken from brine; discard the brine; wipe excess from chicken with paper towels.

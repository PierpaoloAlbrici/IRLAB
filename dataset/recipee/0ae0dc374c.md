### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 6 cup of watermelon, raw

 - 3 tablespoon of lime juice, raw

### Instructions

In a medium sauce pan, bring sugar and water to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the sugar is completely dissolved. Turn off the heat and allow to cool. Put the watermelon chunks and the lime juice into a blender. Process the mixture until the watermelon is completely pureed. Using a fine mesh strainer or sieve, pour and press the blended mixture through to remove the seeds and any extra pulp. Combine with the cooled simple syrup and refrigerate for 1 hour. Pour the watermelon mixture into the freezer bowl of your ice cream maker. Mix until the sorbet has thickened, approximately 2535 minutes. The sorbet will have soft serve texture. You can enjoy right away or put the sorbet into an airtight container and place in the freezer until firm, about 2 hours.

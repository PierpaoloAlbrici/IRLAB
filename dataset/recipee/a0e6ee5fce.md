### Ingredients

 - 6 pound of cabbage, raw

 - 8 pound of bacon, meatless

 - 24 ounce of water, bottled, generic

 - 32 ounce of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 44 ounce of vinegar, distilled

 - 4 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 tablespoon of salt, table

 - 4 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder

### Instructions

Fully cook bacon. While it is still hot, fill a food processor with bacon (do not add the grease to processor!) and chop it into coarse bits (If processor is not available, you should chop the bacon prior to cooking). Put hot chopped bacon in a strainer on a bowl to catch excess grease. Repeat until all bacon is chopped. Set bacon bits aside. Start with a Gallon container with a large mouth. Add sugar, vinegar, water, oil, salt, garlic. Stir with a large mixing spoon, making sure you get all the sugar off the bottom of the container. Heat the amount of dressing you plan on using on the stove on low heat or a steam table, stopping short of a boil (you will use 4-6 oz per serving). Fill salad bowls with shredded cabbage. Sprinkle about 2 tbsp of the fresh bacon bits on top of cabbage. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Immediately before serving, stir hot dressing well, then use a ladle to pour about 4-6 oz on the slaw making sure you thoroughly wet all the cabbage and bacon. Enjoy!

Instructions: 

Add water, yeast, canola oil and honey to the pan of the bread machine; stir to dissolve yeast. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. In a large bowl, stir together oat bran, whole wheat flour, bread flour, flax seed meal and salt. Pour this mixture into the pan of the bread machine. Select Whole Wheat cycle; press Start. After the dough has risen, remove it from the bread machine and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Form into a loaf shape and place in a lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pan. Let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 30 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped.

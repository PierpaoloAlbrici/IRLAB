 - 50 g of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt

 - 1 cup of honey

### Instructions

Heat the sesame seeds in a shallow pan without any oil, until they begin to jump about and turn golden. Shake the pan so that they do not stick or burn. Allow to cool. Using a heavy pan, heat the margarine and then add the honey. Stir continuously until the mixture begins to caramelise. Pour the sesame seeds into the warm mixture and stir thoroughly. Transfer the mixture into a flat tin. As the mixture cools, shape it into sticks either by cutting or rolling, and then coating it with more sesame seeds if required.

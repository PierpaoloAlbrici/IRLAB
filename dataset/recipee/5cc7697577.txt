Pineapple-Orange Ice Cube Tray Pops


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of pineapple juice, canned or bottled, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid


 - 1 cup of orange juice, raw


Instructions: 

In a pitcher, add both juices and stir well. Fill each ice cube trays full. Freeze for 1 hour. Remove and add a pop stick in the center of each ice cube pop (they will slip right in when just partially frozen). Place back in the freezer, preferably overnight. When ready to serve, remove tray, lightly twist (to loosen cubes) and serve. You will not see young ones with juice running down their arms from melting regular-sized freezer homemade pops. They are easy to handle and are great to cool you down! Easy and nutritious. Some other combinations I like are cherry-lime pops, orange and cream, and chocolate Yoo Hoo pops. Have fun with them. We sure do!

Heat the oil in a heavy skillet and cook the shallots and garlic 3 to 4 minutes, until they are soft and transparent but not brown. Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the ground peanuts, soy sauce, molasses, lime juice, ginger, and chilies or cayenne. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Allow to cool slightly before serving with chicken satay or satay ayam (see my recipe posted on this site).

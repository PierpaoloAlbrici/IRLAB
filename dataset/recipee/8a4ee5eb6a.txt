Easy Flour Tortillas


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 34 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Combine the flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl. In another bowl combine the warm water and oil. Add the water/oil mixture to the flour mixture, one tablespoon at a time and mix the dough with a fork. Once the water is mixed in, add another tablespoon of water and repeat the process until all the water is mixed into the dough. (At this point the dough is still sticky. ). Lightly flour a board, or the counter and knead the dough 5 minutes; adding flour as needed to prevent stickiness. Once you have a nice smooth dough, place the dough back into the bowl and cover it with a damp towel or damp paper towel. Let the dough rest for 20 minutes. Divide the dough into golf-ball-size balls by pinching off the dough with your thumb and fore finger. Form each ball into a nice ball shape. Place the balls on a flat dish making sure they don't touch each other and cover with the damp cloth. Let the dough rest again for 10 minutes. Roll out the balls into flat circles; about a fourth of an inch thick. Fry in an un-greased skillet until brown spots appear on both sides. Usually 30-60 seconds per side.

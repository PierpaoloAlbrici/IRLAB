 - 12 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

Peel the horseradish root and cut it into several pieces. Turn on a food processor and drop the pieces through the food tube, a few at a time, and process until evenly ground.

Pour the horseradish oil into a jar, cover tightly, and refrigerate for 8 hours, or overnight. Line as strainer with dampened cheesecloth. Place the strainer over a bowl and pour the oil into the strainer for about 4 hours to allow the all the oil to drain into the bowl. Discard the contents of the strainer. Refrigerate the oil, tightly covered, for up to 2 weeks. Return to room temperature before using.

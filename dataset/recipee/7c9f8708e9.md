### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular

 - 3 tablespoon of sauce, fish, ready-to-serve

### Instructions

Gently fold the roe into the mayonnaise in a small bowl. Refrigerate until you are ready to use. Note: You can add a little Tabasco or chopped shallots, or whatever, but I really like the pure taste of the roe. I used sweetfish roe, because that was what the market used, it is a finely textured roe.

Instructions: 

To make pot sticker wrappers - Combine flour and water in a mixing bowl. Knead on a lightly floured surface until dough no longer sticks to your hands. If more water is needed, add only by the teaspoon. Make a log shape with the dough of about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Cut dough at roughly 1inch intervals...be generous if you like larger pot stickers. Roll into balls and roll each ball flat with rolling pin. If you are stacking the wrappers to fill later, add flour between each wrapper to avoid them sticking. Otherwise, fill with pork mixture straight away and fold over in half, crimping the edges closed with your fingertips. Begin to stir fry pork until slightly browned. Drain any excess fat if necessary then add remaining ingredients. Continue to stir until meat is completely cooked and everything is simmering nicely together. Fill the pot sticker wrappers using a teaspoon and fill to your desire. Grease a large frying pan and place pot stickers creased side up so the bottom flattens. Fry for a few minutes until bottom is golden brown. Pour a cup of water carefully into the pan then cover and let steam on medium heat for 20-25 minutes. Continue to check and add more water to pan if necessary. If you like a kick to your dish, try a side cup of soya sauce with a chopped scotch bonnet pepper for dipping

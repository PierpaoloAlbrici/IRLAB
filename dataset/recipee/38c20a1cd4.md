### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of salt, table

 - 1 tablespoon of beans, snap, green, raw

### Instructions

In your food processor (or a blender would work) mix the salt and vanilla bean paste together. Place in an airtight container. Alternate method cut open a vanilla bean and stick it in your salt shaker for a few days until the flavours come together. This can be used on seafood or fish, also on veggies. You can also use it in any dish where sweet and savoury are being combined. Have fun. Be imaginative. The possibilities are endless. Source: Cooking with Paula Deen

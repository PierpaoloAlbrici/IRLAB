### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 F. In a large bowl combine the flour, baking powder, salt, vanilla extract, and sugar and mix well.

If the mixture is a little sticky for handling try refrigerating it for 30 minutes to an hour to help firm it up. Drop the dough onto a greased baking sheet by the tablespoon-sized scoop, spacing each about 2 inches apart. Bake them for about 8-10 minutes or until they are golden brown.

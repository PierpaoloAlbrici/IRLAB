### Ingredients

 - 5 pound of pickles, cucumber, sour

 - 2 ounce of horseradish, prepared

 - 1/2 ounce of sauce, peppers, hot, chili, mature red, canned

 - 6 tablespoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Preparing Cucumbers: wash the cucumbers under running water and place in a bowl. Cover with ice water and enough ice to keep them cold for 10 hours. Drain the cucumbers and trim both ends so that the brine will more easily penetrate the flesh. Assembling: Rinse the dill and divide in half. Scrub and rinse the horseradish and slice thinly. Peel and halve the garlic. Fold half the dill into a ring to fit the bottom of the pickling jar. Strew horseradish, garlic, red pepper, and 13 of the tarragon on top. Arrange half the cucumbers upright in the jar, packing them tightly. Place the second third of the tarragon on top, then pack in the rest of the cucumbers in the same manner. Over them layer the remaining dill, horseradish, garlic, pepper and tarragon. Combine the salt and water, stirring until the salt dissolves. Toss in jars. Let sit.

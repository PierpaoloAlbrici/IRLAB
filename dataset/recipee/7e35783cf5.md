[7e35783cf5](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/fresh-fruit-ice-cream-in-a-baggie/)

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1/4 cup of strawberries, raw

 - 4 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1/4 cup of salt, table

### Instructions

Combine the half and half, sugar, vanilla, and strawberries in a quart size resealable plastic bag. Press the air out of the bag, seal, and shake bag to combine contents. Place the bag into a gallon sized zip top bag. Add the ice to the gallon bag, press the air out, and seal bag. Wrap bags in a hand towel. Shake continuously, until the contents of the small bag thickens into soft-serve ice cream, 5 to 10 minutes. Rinse the small bag quickly under cold water to wash off salt. Lay the ice cream filled baggie on a flat surface. Use a wooden spoon handle to push the ice cream down to the bottom corner of the baggie. Snip off the corner, and squeeze ice cream into a bowl.

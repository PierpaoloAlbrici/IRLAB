Simple & Fluffy Table Rolls


Ingredients


 - 200 g of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 10 g of sugars, granulated


 - 3 g of salt, table


 - 4 g of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 130 ml of water, bottled, generic


 - 30 g of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Add bread flour and sugar to a bowl. Put the dry yeast on top. Put the skim milk on one side and the salt on the other. Microwave the water for 30 seconds. Pour it over the dry yeast. Stir it around with a spatula. When the dough comes together, transfer onto a work surface and knead for about 10 minutes. It will stretch out nicely. When almost done, add the butter and knead some more. After the dough becomes smooth and shiny, let it sit and rise for 40 to 50 minutes. Punch out the air gently. Divide into 6 portions. Roll it up into balls and let sit for about 15 minutes. Form into whatever shapes you like Let rise for a second time, for 40 to 50 minutes. Preheat oven to 220C while the bread is fermenting. You can see in the photo that I've been experimenting with different ways to roll them up. When the dough has doubled in size, it's done. Brush the tops with a beaten egg (unlisted) and bake in 220C oven for 12 minutes. Done. This photo shows what the dough looks like when baked in balls. I've mixed in some walnuts and mixed dried fruit, and also ham and mayonnaise.

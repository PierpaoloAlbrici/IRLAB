### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 3 1/2 cup of celery, raw

 - 1 cup of onions, raw

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, caraway seed

 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

### Instructions

In a medium saucepan simmer water, celery, onion, and caraway seeds until celery is very tender, about 30 minutes. Cool mixture slightly and in a blender puree in batches until smooth, transferring to a bowl. Stir in buttermilk and salt and pepper to taste. Chill soup, covered, at least until cold, about 6 hours, and up to 1 day (after that, it will lose its fresh taste). Before serving, season with salt and pepper, if necessary.

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 4 tablespoon of seeds, chia seeds, dried

### Instructions

I am not going into any details about dough consistency, tips for using a pasta machine, etc. I will only say that if you've never made fresh pasta before (especially gluten-free) you'll need some practice before it comes out right. I started by soaking the chia seeds in the water for 15 minutes, and stirred to create an egg-like mixture. (I think I only ended up using about a 1/4 cup of the chia mixture) Add the flour a little at a time to the chia seed mixture, until you end up with a good firm ball of dough. Roll out dough using a pasta machine, and cut how you like for fettuccine, lasagne, etc. I made thicker fettuccine with it because I was concerned that the seeds might create voids that would allow the pasta to break or fall apart if I went too thin. I cooked this pasta immediately after preparing. I typically dry my fresh pasta in the freezer or by hanging before cooking, and I assume you can do that with this too.

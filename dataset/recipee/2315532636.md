Sprinkle the yeast over the top and attach bowl to your bread machine. Set your bread machine to the dough cycle and hit start. Thats itits like magic! The dough should be smooth and easy to work with. Roll it out to the desired thickness (keep in mind the dough rises a bit in the oven). Then top with your favorite toppings and bake.

### Ingredients

 - 1 1/3 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 1/2 tablespoon of cornstarch

 - 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 3 tablespoon of honey

 - 2 1/2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1/8 teaspoon of vanilla extract

### Instructions

Combine the milk and salt in a saucepan over medium heat, and bring to a boil. In a cup or small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in cold water. When the milk begins to boil, stir in the cornstarch mixture, and cook stirring constantly until it thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in the honey, butter, and vanilla. Pour into a serving dish, cover, and chill. To keep a skin from forming on the top, place a layer of plastic wrap directly on the surface.

Curried Soda Bread


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, curry powder


 - 1 1/4 teaspoon of spices, caraway seed


 - 2 tablespoon of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


 - 1/3 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


Instructions: 

In a large bowl, mix flour, baking soda, curry powder, and caraway seeds. Add the margarine and cut it in until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the buttermilk and honey to the flour mixture. Stir to make soft dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. If dough seems too dry, add a little more buttermilk. If it seems too sticky, add a little more flour. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured board to a circle that is 1/4-inch thick. Place on a cookie sheet and bake until golden brown and crispy, about 7 to 8 minutes. Cut into wedges.

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 cup of syrups, corn, light

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 2 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

### Instructions

Dissolve over a medium low heat in a large, heavy pan stirring until the mixture boils: 2 cups sugar, 2 cups dark corn syrup (I have used a combination of both dark and light, too), 1 cup of butter (no substitutes) and l cup of cream Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly to 240 degrees. Remove from stove and gradually add l more cup of cream. Return to heat and cook until 244-246 degrees. Pour mixture at once without scraping (makes it tough) into a buttered 9x13 pan. Cool about three hours until fairly firm. Invert onto cutting surface and using a thin, sharp knife (I use a chef's knife) cut into one inch pieces. Wrap in pieces of waxed paper.

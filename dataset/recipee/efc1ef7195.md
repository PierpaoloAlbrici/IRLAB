### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of lemon juice, raw

 - 1 1/3 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 ounce of pectin, unsweetened, dry mix

### Instructions

In a 3 or 4 quart saucepan, mix together the lemon juice, sugar, and pectin and bring to a boil, stirring at first to smooth and blend the ingredients. Allow to boil exactly 2 minutes and remove from the heat. Wet a strong paper towel or a fine textured dishcloth with cold water, wring out, and place the paper or cloth in a strainer over a pyrex 2-cup measure. Let the jelly slowly drip through. Cool and seal, or cool and refrigerate. Orange Jelly: Use 1/2 cup orange juice plus 1/4 cup lemon juice and grated zest of 1 orange (this is strained out after imparting its flavor).

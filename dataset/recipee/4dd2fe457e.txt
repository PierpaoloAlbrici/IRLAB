Zesty Honey Sriracha Grilled Chicken Wings


Ingredients


 - 1/4 cup of sauce, barbecue


 - 2 tablespoon of orange juice, raw


 - 1/4 cup of orange juice, raw


 - 1/4 cup of sauce, hot chile, sriracha


 - 1/2 cup of honey


 - 1/4 cup of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 5 pound of chicken, broilers or fryers, wing, meat and skin, raw


 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


Instructions: 

Mix the barbecue sauce, 1 tablespoon of the orange zest, orange juice, Sriracha hot sauce, 1/4 cup of honey and 1/4 cup Dijon mustard together in a large bowl. Add the chicken wings and toss to combine. Cover and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Heat the grill to medium high heat. Remove the chicken wings from the marinade and discard the marinade. Place the chicken wings on the grill and grill about 8 minutes per side. While the wings are grilling, prepare the glaze. Melt the butter in a small saucepan on a medium high heat. Whisk in 1/4 cup honey, 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard and remaining 1 tablespoon orange zest. Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to low. Pour a little of the glaze into a small bowl. When you flip the chicken over, brush a little of the glaze (from the small bowl) over each chicken wing and continue cooking. Discard the glaze in the bowl when you are done because it will have raw chicken juices in it). After the wings are thoroughly cooked, place them on a large serving platter and pour the remaining glaze from the pot over the wings.

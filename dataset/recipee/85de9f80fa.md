### Ingredients

 - 3 1/3 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

 - 5 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 4 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Place oven rack in middle position. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Bring the water to a boil. Keep the water covered as it boils so you don't lose too much as steam. When the oven is at 375, put the water, rice, and salt into an ovenproof pot with a tight-fitting lid. I have successfully used pyrex dishes and cast-iron dutch ovens. If you don't have a good lid, you can also use a double layer of foil. Just make sure it's sealed well around the edges. Pop it in the oven. The rice is done when it is tender and the water is all gone. It usually takes an hour. When it's done, fluff it with a fork and serve. Yum! So simple and good!

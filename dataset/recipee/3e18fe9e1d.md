[3e18fe9e1d](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/desserts/halloween-white-chocolate-peanut-butter-fudge/)

### Ingredients

 - 11 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 14 ounce of milk, canned, condensed, sweetened

 - 1 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

 - 4 drop of orange juice, raw

### Instructions

1. Heat the white chocolate, sweetened condensed milk and peanut butter over a double boiler until melted. 2. Take bowl off the heat and stir in a few drops of orange food coloring until the desired color is reached. 3. Pour into an 8x8 baking pan lined with parchment paper (make sure the paper hangs over two sides of the pan so you can use it as a handle to remove the fudge once set). Let it set in the fridge for a few hours or overnight. 4. Remove fudge from pan. Cut out the pumpkin shapes with a cookie cutter. If you are not cutting them in pumpkin shapes you can cut into small squares. Inspired by the holiday, these pumpkin fudge bites are perfect for any Halloween party. As soon as we came across the mini pumpkin cut out, we new we had to make these. Using white chocolate is perfect for this because it allows you to have a nice vibrant orange pumpkin. Enjoy!

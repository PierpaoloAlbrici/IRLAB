Coconut Joys


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 2 cup of sugars, powdered


 - 3 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


 - 23 cup of candies, semisweet chocolate


Instructions: 

Melt the butter in large pot over low heat. Take the pot off the heat. Stir in sugar and coconut. Shape into 3/4-inch balls and place on a large cookie sheet or sheet pan. Submerge chocolate morsels bag in simmering hot water until melted, about 5 minutes. Snip a tiny piece off one corner of the bag. Drizzle chocolate over the joys. Chill on cookie sheet until balls are firm and chocolate is set before storing in bags or serving. In general, try to store these in the refrigerator. I am okay with them out of fridge in gift boxes for a while though.

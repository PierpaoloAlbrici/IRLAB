Ingredients


 - 3 1/2-4 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw


 - 2 1/2-3 tablespoon of butter, without salt

Coat each chicken piece thoroughly in the flour mixture and place on the wire rack/sheet pan, then place in the fridge for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, pre-heat oven to 425*F. Put butter into 9x13x2 baking dish (or a larger 18x12x2 roaster pan, depending on the size of your chicken portions) and place dish in the oven just until the butter melts.

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 12 cup of molasses

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 14 cup of spices, caraway seed

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

Mix first six ingredients together in a large bowl and let cool until molasses mixture is just warm. Dissolve yeast and brown sugar in 1/2 cup warm water and add to molasses mixture. Stir in unbleached white flour and whole wheat flour until dough is soft enough to knead. Knead briskly 5 to 10 minutes. Let rise approximately 30 minutes and then divide mixture into 2 round loaves. Place both loaves on a vegetable oil-sprayed cookie sheet and let rise 20 minutes. Bake for 1 hour in a preheated oven at 375 degrees F. Allow bread to cool before slicing. Serve warm.

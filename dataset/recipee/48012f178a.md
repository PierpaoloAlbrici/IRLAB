### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1/4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, rosemary, dried

 - 1/3 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 2 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1/4 cup of tomatoes, sun-dried

### Instructions

Add all ingredients except tomatoes to bread machine in the order listed, making a little indention in the flour for the yeast. Turn on machine (use white bread setting). If tomatoes are packed in oil, first blot them dry with a paper towel. Cut or snip tomatoes into small pieces -- but do not add them until after the first knead. Otherwise, your bread will be pink. It will still taste good, but it will not have pretty chunks of tomatoes. If your machine has a fruit and nuts setting, add the tomatoes when that beeper goes off.

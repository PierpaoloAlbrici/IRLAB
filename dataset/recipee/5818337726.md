### Ingredients

 - 2/3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 tablespoon of oats

 - 1/3 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1/4 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1/2 cup of nuts, pecans

 - 1 cup of blackberries, raw

 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 tablespoon of cornstarch

 - 4 cup of blueberries, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. For the topping, in the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, oats, brown sugar, and cinnamon, and process briefly to mince the oats. Add the butter and process until the mixture looks moist and begins to stick together. Stir in the pecans. Transfer to a small bowl and refrigerate. In a large saucepan over high heat, stir together the raspberries, granulated sugar, and cornstarch. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring, until the mixture is slightly thick and shiny, about 3 minutes. Stir in the blueberries and pour into a baking dish. Crumble the topping over the berries and bake for 30 minutes, or until golden. Remove the dish from the oven, drizzle the honey over the topping, and return to the oven for 5 minutes. Cool for at least 15 minutes before serving. Serve warm.

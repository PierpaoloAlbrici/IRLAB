### Ingredients

 - 2/3 cup of molasses

 - 1 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of vinegar, distilled

 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 15 cup of corn, sweet, white, raw

### Instructions

Combine molasses, sugar, water, vinegar, and salt in heavy saucepan. Place over low heat, stirring till mix begins to boil. Cook, without stirring, to 275 degrees or possibly till a few drops form hard ball when dropped in cool water. Remove from heat; add in butter, stirring only sufficient to combine with other ingredients. Pour over popcorn in a large greased pan, using a wooden spoon to mix well till every kernel is coated. With hands slightly greased form popcorn into balls, using only a little pressure so they will stay together.

Butter Sticks Recipe


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 3/4 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 1/2 cup of spices, poppy seed


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 425 . Heat butter in a 7" x 11" pan. Mix flour, sugar and lowfat milk, keeping the dough as soft as possible. Let it "rest" for one minute. Knead gently on a floured cloth. Roll dough to size of pan. Cut lengthwise in the center of the dough. Cut the dough crosswise at 3/4 inch intervals with a sharp, floured knife to make sticks approximately 3/4" x 3 1/2." Roll in the melted butter, completely coating the sticks. Sprinkle sesame or possibly poppy seeds on top. Bake for 12-15 min, or possibly till golden. Allow to sit till excess butter is absorbed - usually a minute or possibly so. Serve while warm!! !

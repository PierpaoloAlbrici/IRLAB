Flocking Cookies With Colored Sugars


Ingredients


 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

to suggest the textural effect of an elegant flocked fabric or trim, generously sprinkle a fairly fine grained colored sugar over areas already decorated with royal icing or powdered sugar icing BEFORE the icing had a chance to set; immediately shake off excess sugar. For the best effect the sugar used for flocking should be a color similiar to the icing underneath. Depending on the look you desire, you can flock a large flat area or only the raised piped details ofa design.

Boston Brown Bread


Ingredients


 - 2 1/3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3/4 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of blueberries, raw


 - 1 quart of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 3/4 cup of molasses


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 300. Generously butter three 10-ounce coffee cans. In a very large bowl, combine the rye, all-purpose, whole wheat and oat flours. Stir in the cornmeal, baking soda, baking powder, salt and dried fruit. In a bowl, whisk the milk with the molasses. Slowly pour the liquid into the dry ingredients, stirring until the batter is smooth. Pour the batter into the prepared cans. Stand the cans in the center of the oven and bake for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the loaves are springy to the touch. Let cool slightly, then unmold. When the loaves have cooled to room temperature, wrap them in wax paper and store in the refrigerator in a sturdy plastic bag for up to 5 days.

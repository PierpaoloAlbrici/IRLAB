Chocolate Curls


Ingredients


 - 8 ounce of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022


Instructions: 

For Large Chocolate Curls: Melt the chocolate over low heat. Spread it out in a thin sheet on a flat surface-but not so thin that you can see the surface through the chocolate. If you have a marble slab, use it. If not, use a baking sheet. Let the chocolate cool. Using a bakers bench scraper or a wide, flat metal spatula, scrape up the chocolate into wide curls, lifting them up as you work. The curls will be different widths and lengths, but thats fine. If the chocolate curls up into one long sheet, let it cool more before scraping again. Carefully place the curls where you want them on the cake. If you are decorating the side of the cake with them, press the curls gently into the frosting with your fingers so they stay, without falling off. For Smaller Chocolate Curls: Buy a thick bar of chocolate and use at room temperature (not straight from the refrigerator). Stand up the chocolate bar vertically, slightly on an angle, against a flat surface, such as a chopping board. Slowly scrape down the bar with a vegetable peeler, allowing the chocolate to fall away into a pile of soft curls. Using a wide, flat metal spatula, carefully place them on the cake.

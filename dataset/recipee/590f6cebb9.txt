Steak Marinade


Ingredients


 - 14 cup of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 3 tablespoon of honey


 - 2 tablespoon of vinegar, balsamic


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 12 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 1/2 pound of beef, flank, steak, separable lean and fat, trimmed to 0" fat, all grades, cooked, broiled


Instructions: 

In a blender or bowl combine soy sauce, honey, vinegar, ginger, garlic powder and oil. Blend until well mixed. Lay steak in a shallow glass or ceramic dish or a ziploc bag. You may pierce flesh all over front and back with a fork, however I prefer not to pierce meat. Pour marinade over steak, then turn and coat other side. Cover and chill in the refrigerator 8 hours or overnight. Preheat outdoor grill for high heat. Place grate on highest level and brush lightly with oil. Grill steak to desired doneness.

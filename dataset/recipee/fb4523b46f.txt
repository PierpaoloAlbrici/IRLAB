Baked Almond Pie Shell Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 1/3 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 3 teaspoon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Coarsely chop the almonds. Combine all ingredients in a medium bowl, stirring till dry ingredients are moistened. Press into a 9-inch pieplate. Bake at 375 degrees for 20 min. Cold on a wire rack. Makes a great shell with a nutty flavor/texture. Use with a fruit recipe which "sets-up" without baking.

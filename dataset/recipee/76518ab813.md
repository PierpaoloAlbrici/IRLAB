### Ingredients

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 2-3 pound of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw

 - 12 cup of onions, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of seasoning mix, dry, taco, original

 - 1 cup of sauce, salsa, ready-to-serve

### Instructions

Heat oil in a large skillet. Add beef chunks and brown on all sides to carmelize. Remove to crockpot. Add onion to drippings and saute until lightly browned. Stir in taco seasonings and heat about 1 minute. Add salsa and stir, scraping up any browned bits. Transfer liquid to crockpot. Stir to combine. Cook on low 6-8 hours. * You can use any kind of salsa. It doesn't have to be salsa verde, but we like the flavor it adds to the beef.

### Ingredients

 - 1 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of sugars, brown

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 2 cup of nuts, pecans

 - 23 cup of butter, without salt

 - 12 cup of sugars, brown

 - 2 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F. In large bowl, combine flour and 1 cup brown sugar and mix with fingers. Stir in 1/2 cup melted butter until mixture looks like cornmeal. Pat evenly into a 13 x 9 baking pan that has been sprayed with non-stick baking spray. Sprinkle pecans over crust. In a small saucepan, combine 2/3 cup butter and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until mixture boils for 1 minute and looks syrupy. Drizzle mixture over pecans. Bake bars at 350F for 17-22 minutes until bubbly over entire surface. Remove from oven and sprinkle immediately with milk chocolate chips. Let melt for a few minutes, then swirl a knife through some of the chips to marble. NOTE: Let set for about an hour before cutting, as the chocolate will need to set up.

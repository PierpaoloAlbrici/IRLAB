Cheese Board Corn Cherry Scones


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 23 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 1/2 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 34 cup of cherries, sweet, raw


 - 1 1/4 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 425. Adjust rack in center of oven. Line 1 or 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or a baking mat. Sift together flour, baking soda and baking powder into a large bowl. Add salt, 2/3 cup sugar, and the cornmeal. Stir with a wooden spoon until combined. Add butter and cut in with a pastry cutter until it is the size of small peas. Using the spoon, mix in cherries. Make a well in the center; add buttermilk. Mix briefly, until ingredients just come together; some loose flour should remain at bottom of bowl. Let the batter stand for 5 minutes. Gently shape the dough into balls about 2 1/4 inches in diameter (they should have a rough, rocky exterior) and place them on the prepared pans about 2 inches apart. Sprinkle the 1/4 cup sugar on top of the scones. Place the scones on the middle rack of the oven and immediately turn the temperature down to 375. Bake 20-25 minutes, or until the scones are golden. Transfer the scones to a wire rack to cool.

### Ingredients

 - 29 ounce of tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 300F. Place a wire rack on top of a baking sheet. Gently lift the tomatoes out of the boxes, taking care to keep the tomatoes attached to the stems as much as possible. Brush the tomatoes with the olive oil and season with the salt and pepper. Place the tomatoes in the oven to roast until their skins are shriveled but the tomatoes are still plump, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the tomatoes from the oven and allow them to cool to room temperature. Use the tomatoes, or cover with plastic wrap and store at room temperature for up to one day or refrigerate for up to three days. Bring the tomatoes to room temperature before serving.

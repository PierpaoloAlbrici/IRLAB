Blueberry Lemon Jam Recipe


Ingredients


 - 4 1/2 cup of blueberries, raw


 - 7 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 9 ounce of pectin, unsweetened, dry mix


Instructions: 

Pick over the fresh blueberries to remove any stalks and rinse under cool water. Drain well and place in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan. (Don't rinse or possibly thaw frzn berries.) Crush the berries slightly with a potato masher or possibly pestle. Stir in the sugar, lemon juice, and zest. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring often. When the mix reaches a full boil, cook for 1 minute. Stir in the pectin. Return to a full boil, then cook for another minute. Ladle into warm, sterilized jars leaving 1/4-inch of headroom. Wipe the rims clear and put the lids on top of the jars. Process in a boiling water bath for about 5 min. Remove from the water and cold completely at room temperature.

 - 6 tablespoon of nuts, cashew nuts, raw


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

Instructions: 

Lightly oil a 9- by 13-inch glass baking pan with canola oil spray. In a large bowl, combine the agave nectar, nut butter, salt, cinnamon, and vanilla extract. Mix until well blended. Add the cereal, apricots, and cashews and mix well. Firmly press the mixture into the prepared baking pan and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2 or more hours, or until firm.

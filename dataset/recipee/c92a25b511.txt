Hayes Street Grill Apricot Crisp


Ingredients


 - 8 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 4 cup of apricots, dried, sulfured, uncooked


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 375F (190C). Lightly butter a 9-inch pie pan or shallow, round baking dish with a little of the butter. Toss the fruit in lemon juice and granulated sugar to taste. Pile into a baking dish. Combine the flour, remaining butter, brown sugar, salt and cinnamon in a bowl. Rub together with fingertips until the mixture is crumbly. Sprinkle on top of the fruit. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, until the fruit is bubbly around the edges and the top has browned. Allow to cool briefly; serve while still warm, with whipped cream, creme fraiche or ice cream.

Applesauce Cake


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of sugars, brown


 - 12 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 cup of raisins, seeded


 - 1 1/2 cup of applesauce, canned, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid (includes usda commodity)


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cloves, ground


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 cup of nuts, almonds


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cream Earth Balance, shortening or other oil with sugar. In small bowl, mix together vanilla extract, applesauce, spices and baking soda. Combine applesauce mixture with creamed margarine and sugar, and gradually add flour until all is combined. Fold in dried fruit, nuts or whatever you may be adding. Sprinkle with sliced almonds, if using, and spread batter into a well greased 9 x 13 pan. Bake 20-25 minutes, until top is golden, and knife inserted in middle comes out clean. The top will be spongy to the touch... which makes it pretty fun to poke. If using smaller pan, recommended 8&#8243;-9&#8243; pan, bake about 40-50 minutes, or until top is golden brown, and knife inserted in center comes out clean. Muffin cups should take a little less time than the 9 x 13 inch pan... watch until they have risen and are golden brown. Let cool and serve.

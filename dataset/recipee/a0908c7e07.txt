Instructions: 

Butter or grease two loaf pans. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, salt, and pepper (if using); set aside. Stir the butter into the scalded milk; let cool to room temperature. Once the milk has cooled you can begin to make the dough by pouring the water into the bowl of your stand mixer. Whisk in yeast, wait a minute, then whisk again to be sure all the yeast is completely dissolved; whisk in the cooled milk and butter mixture. Stir in half the flour with a large rubber spatula, then stir in the remaining flour, in smaller batches, to ensure all the flour is moistened. Place the bowl on the stand mixer, fitted with the dough hook, and beat on medium speed until the dough gets smoother, but not competely smooth, about 2 minutes; let rest 10 minutes. Add the cheese and nuts then beat, on medium speed, until the dough becomes smoother and more elastic, about 2 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly oil bowl to rise, turning to coat all sides with oil; drape oiled plastic wrap on top and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Turn dough out on a lightly floured work area, turn over, press to deflate, then set aside (in oiled bowl) to rise again, about 1 hour. Turn dough out onto floured board and divide in half, taking care not to delate dough too much; shape each half into an 8 to 9 inch square. Roll dough tightly, jelly roll fashion, pinching the edge in when you get to the end; place loaf in pan, seam side down, pressing it into place so that the surface is fairly even. Cover with oiled plastic wrap and let rise another hour; once risen, the dough should protrude about 1 inch over the rim of the loaf pan. Set oven rack to the middle and heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Uncover loaves, and place in the center of the oven rack, short side toward each other, equal distance from each other and the sides of the oven. Bake until the bread is risen, and is deep golden and firm; the internal temperature should be more than 200 degrees F, about 45 minutes. Unmold each loaf and cool, on its side, on a rack (this prevents falling). You can brush the breads with melted butter if you like your crusts soft. Let cool completely before slicing with a sharp serrated knife. Store at room temperature, in a plastic bag, or freeze for longer storage.

Candied Spiced Mixed Nuts Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 4 cup of nuts, walnuts, english


 - 2/3 cup of strawberries, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, paprika


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cumin seed


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, paprika


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cumin seed


Instructions: 

Lightly oil a large stainless steel bowl. Place nuts inside. Set aside. In a small saucepan heat the strawberry jelly over medium heat. Add in the paprika and cumin. Cook the mix to the hard ball stage (260 degrees measured on a candy thermometer. You can test for the hard ball stage by dropping a tsp. of the mix into a glass of iced water. The mix will instantly harden). Immediately pour the mix over the nuts. Stir with a wooden spoon to proportionately coat the nut mix. Allow the mix to cold for five min. Once it is cold sufficient to handle, sprinkle the nuts with the brown sugar coating. Stir to combine. Let cold completely, then pack into decorative, airtight tines. Variations: Use Orange Marmalade in place of the Strawberry Jelly. Yield: 3 1/2 c.. Preparation Time: 40 min.

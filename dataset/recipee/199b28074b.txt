Magnificent Mango Ice Cream


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of mango nectar, canned


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 7 ounce of milk, canned, condensed, sweetened


 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 teaspoon of lime juice, raw


 - 2 teaspoon of alcoholic beverage, distilled, vodka, 80 proof


Instructions: 

Place mangoes and sugar in blender and process until smooth. Add milks, lime juice and coconut rum or vodka to the container and blend until thoroughly combined. Adjust sugar to taste, it should be fairly sweet. Pour into ice cream freezer and process per manufacturers directions. My Cuisinart takes 30 minutes. Place ice cream in a sealable container and put in freezer for at least three hours before serving. This is really good with a number of different add-ins. Try any of the following: mini chocolate chips, vanilla chips, sweetened shredded coconut, chopped candied ginger or orange peel.

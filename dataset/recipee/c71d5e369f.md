### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

 - 2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Here's how: In a mason jar, combine 1/2 cup cultured buttermilk (the supermarket stuff is okay here; it will act as a starter), 2 cups whole milk, and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Cover and let stand in a warm place until the buttermilk thickens and coats the sides of the jar when tipped, 24-36 hours. Keep chilled for up to 2 weeks.

Jelly Donut Cupcakes


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of soymilk, original and vanilla, unfortified


 - 1 teaspoon of vinegar, cider


 - 2 tablespoon of cornstarch


 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 34 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 13 cup of oil, canola


 - 34 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 13 cup of grapes, red or green (european type, such as thompson seedless), raw


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, powdered


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line a cupcake tin with paper liners. In a measuring cup, combine the soymilk, vinegar and cornstarch and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg and salt. Create a well in the center of the flour to pour the wet ingredients into. Mix the soymilk mixture with a fork to dissolve the cornstarch and pour into the flour mixture. Add the oil, sugar and vanilla, and mix well. Fill the liners with batter 3/4 full. Place a heaping spoonful of jam into the center of each cupcake, being careful not to overfill. The jam will sink into the cupcake during baking so don't worry about pressing it down. Bake cupcakes for 21 to 23 minutes. Don't do a toothpick test, but tops should be firm. Cool completely on a wire rack, and then set uncovered overnight in a cool and dry place. This will make the tops slightly crispy, like a donut crust. Using a sifter, sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve.

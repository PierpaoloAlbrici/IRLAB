Cooked Chickpeas or Garbanzos (Slow-Cooker)


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of chickpeas (garbanzo beans, bengal gram), mature seeds, raw


 - 5 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

A 3 1/2 or 4 quart slow cooker is ideal. Place the chickpeas in the slow cooker, pour in the water and cook on high for 4 hours. Check to see whether they are tender enough for you - they should not be mushy. If done, drain. Refrigerate for a week, freeze for up to 3 months.

### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 teaspoon of honey

### Instructions

In a large bowl, stir together the flour, salt and yeast. Add the water and honey, and using a wooden spoon, stir together until the mixture resembles a shaggy dough. It will be very sticky. Cover dough with a plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for 818 hours. Dough will bubble up and rise. After dough is ready, preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Turn the dough onto a well-floured surface and with floured hands, form the dough into a ball. Cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rest. While dough is resting, put Dutch oven into the preheated oven for 30 minutes. After the 30 minutes are up, remove the Dutch oven (remember, its super hot) and with floured hands, place the bread dough in it. Replace the cover and bake for 30 minutes covered. Then remove the cover and bake for an additional 15 minutes uncovered. Bread will be golden and crusty.

Honey Roasted Cashews Recipe


Ingredients


 - 4 1/2 cup of nuts, cashew nuts, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


 - 4 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Heat the oven to 350 degrees F and arrange a rack in the middle. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, toss cashews with oil until well coated; set aside. Combine brown sugar, water, and honey in a small saucepan, place over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook until mixture has thickened slightly, about 5 minutes. Drizzle over cashews and stir to coat. Transfer nuts to the prepared baking sheet and spread in a single layer. Bake until golden brown, stirring every 10 minutes, for a total of about 20 to 25 minutes. Sprinkle salt over nuts and stir to coat. Let cool completely on the baking sheet and break up any large pieces before serving.

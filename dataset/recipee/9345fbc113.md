[9345fbc113](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/fleur-de-lait-379930)

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 3/4 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

 - 3 tablespoon of cornstarch

 - 1 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

### Instructions

Warm the milk with the sugar and salt in a medium saucepan. Whisk together the cornstarch and cold heavy cream until dissolved, and stir it into the milk. Heat the mixture, stirring constantly, until it begins to boil and bubble up. Reduce the heat and simmer for 2 minutes, continuing to stir. Remove from the heat and scrape it into a bowl. Chill thoroughly in the refrigerator, stirring the mixture occasionally as it cools. Once well-chilled, whisk to remove any lumps, then freeze the mixture in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturers instructions. Try sandwiching Fleur de Lait between Oatmeal Ice Cream Sandwich Cookies (page 226).

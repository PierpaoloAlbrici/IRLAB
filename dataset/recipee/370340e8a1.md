### Ingredients

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 2 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 14 cup of beans, snap, green, raw

### Instructions

Combine and knead all ingredients (I used my bread machine). Let rise 50-60 minutes. Roll dough on a cornmeal-covered counter. Place dough in pizza pan. For a thin, crispy crust, place toppings on dough and bake immediately. For a thicker, chewier crust, allow dough to rise 15-30 minutes before adding toppings. Place pizza on the bottom rack of oven (Preheated to 500F) 5-10 minutes. We filled our pizzas with pizza sauce, rest of the black beans, tomatoes, zucchini, onions.

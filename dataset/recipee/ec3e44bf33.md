### Ingredients

 - 2 pound of apples, raw, with skin

 - 11 pound of blackberries, raw

 - 1 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 3/4 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1/4 cup of syrups, corn, light

### Instructions

Combine apples, blackberries and water in heavy large pot or Dutch oven. Bring to boil over medium-high heat. Cover, reduce heat to medium and simmer until fruit is tender, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Transfer to sieve set over large bowl. Press to force through as much fruit and liquid as possible. Discard solids in sieve. Return puree to same pot. Add sugar and corn syrup. Stir over low heat just until sugar dissolves. Spoon puree into 13x9x2-inch glass dish. Freeze until almost solid, about 1 hour. Break up frozen puree into chunks. Place in processor; puree. Return to same dish; cover and freeze until firm enough to hold shape in spoon, at least 1 hour.

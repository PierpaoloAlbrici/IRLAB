Crispy Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookie Dough Truffles


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract


 - 2 cup of sugars, powdered


 - 23 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt


 - 2 1/2 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat peanut butter and butter until creamy and smooth. Gradually add in vanilla extract and powdered sugar with the mixture on low, speeding up once it becomes more combined. At this point you should have a cookie dough (depending on your brand of peanut butter you may need a little more sugaradd it 1-2 tablespoons at a time while mixing). Using a spatula, gently fold in crisped rice cereal so it gets distributed through the batter, adding more if desired. Be careful not to crush all the cereal so it stays crispy. Once combined, roll dough into balls (mine were slightly more than teaspoon-sized) and place on a parchment-covered baking sheet. Some of the balls will have crisped rice edges sticking out and some may be crumbly. Thats okay, just roll as smooth as you can, occasionally squeezing the dough together if needed. Refrigerate for 60-90 minutes. Melt chocolate in either the microwave (I melt in 30-second increments while stirring) or in a double boiler. Remove peanut butter balls from the fridge and dip in chocolate, then place back on parchment. Refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving. Store in the refrigerator! Note: if you want the peanut butter drizzle, I simply melted 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips then used a spoon to drizzle.

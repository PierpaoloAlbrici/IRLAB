Coke and Salted Peanuts


Ingredients


 - 7 ounce of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 ounce of oil, corn, peanut, and olive


Instructions: 

Pour the small packet of peanuts into the ice cold coke and drink/chew. NOTE: This seems no good with a glass of Coke -- it has to be the little bottle. TIP If you want your cokes SUPER-COLD, stand them straight up in a cooler of ice (up to the necks) and then carefully pour some rock salt around on the ice. Be careful -- too much salt will cause them to freeze solid! Don't get salt on the caps or you'll taste it in the pop. This is an old Carnival sales trick.

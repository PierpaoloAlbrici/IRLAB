Simple Sour Cream Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 14 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 34 cup of cream, sour, cultured


 - 2 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

Combine flour and baking soda, then add remaining ingredients, stirring just to combine. Place dough on floured surface, knead 4-6 times, then cut into 4 biscuits--you can just use a knife to divide the dough into 4 squares, or use a biscuit cutter for the classic round shape-if you don't have a biscuit cutter, use a drinking glass turned upside down. Brush tops of biscuits with melted butter, or just lightly spray with non-stick cooking spray. Bake at 425 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown.

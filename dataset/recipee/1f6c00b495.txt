Baked Cookie Oatmeal


Ingredients


 - 6 tablespoon of applesauce, canned, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid (includes usda commodity)


 - 2 tablespoon of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

Instructions: 

In a small oven-safe ramekin (I use a 2 c/470 ml ramekin), mix the unsweetened applesauce, peanut butter, honey and vanilla extract (I often mix this the night before, refrigerate, and have less to do in the morning). Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the ramekin from the fridge, if its been in overnight. Stir in the oats, baking powder, and almond meal/flour. Once all mixed, stir in the chocolate chips. Bake for 15 minutes. Eat and enjoy! Recipe Inspiration: The Nutritious Kitchen.

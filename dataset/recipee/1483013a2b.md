### Ingredients

 - 1 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 13 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 13 cup of olives, ripe, canned (small-extra large)

### Instructions

Combine whole wheat flour, all purpose flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a food processor; pulse a few times. Mix water and oil; sprinkle over the dry ingredients and pulse just until blended. Add olives and pulse to mix. (Alternatively, combine dry ingredients in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add the water-oil mixture, stirring until well blended. Stir in olives.) Press the dough into a disk; if it seems dry, add a little more water. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour or longer.

Quinoa, Oatmeal and Raisin Bread


Ingredients


 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 3/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 13 cup of sweetener, syrup, agave


 - 1/4 cup of oil, canola


 - 3 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 2 3/4 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 cup of quinoa, uncooked


 - 3/4 cup of oats


 - 1 cup of raisins, seeded


 - 3/4 cup of nuts, pecans


Instructions: 

In a small bowl, mix together the water and yeast. Let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in the agave nectar and let stand for an additional 5-10 minutes. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook, mix the water/yeast mixture with the oil, milk, salt, cinnamon and 1 cup of the bread flour on low-speed until combined. Add the whole wheat flour, quinoa and oats mixing to combine thoroughly. Add the raisins and pecans continuing to mix together. Slowly add the remaining bread flour and continue mixing until the dough is smooth and elastic, approximately 5 minutes (10-15 minutes if youre kneading by hand.) Dough should be sticky but not wet. Form the dough into a ball and place in a large bowl that youve lightly greased with canola oil. Turn the dough to coat it with the oil and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Let the dough rise in a warm location until doubled in size, approximately 2 hours. Punch dough down and divide in half. Place each dough half into a separate standard size loaf pan that youve coated with cooking spray. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rise until doubled in size (approximately 1 hour). Preheat oven to 400 F at the end of the rise time. Put a baking dish on the bottom rack of the oven and add several ice cubes to create steam. Place the bread in the center of the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Then cover the loaves loosely with a sheet of foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes. Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Remove from pan and cool completely on a wire rack.

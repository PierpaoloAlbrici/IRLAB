Tangy Beef or Pork Marinade


Ingredients


 - 14 cup of vinegar, red wine


 - 18 cup of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 14 cup of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 12 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


Instructions: 

Mix red wine vinegar, soy sauce, maple syrup, ginger, mustard. Stir well. Taste for your own taste preferences. It should have a sweet tangy taste. Add garlic, sesame oil and optional red pepper flakes. Mix well. Pour into ziploc bag, add meat and press out all air. Marinate in fridge for several hours shaking the contents often as the oil will separate. I usually marinate overnight, but a couple hours is fine too. Marinating overnight makes the meat extremely tender and flavorful. The soy sauce measurement is low for our taste preference as we don't like it's salty taste. You can adjust however you wish to your liking. I don't measure any of the ingredients and I add alot of ginger and red pepper flakes because we like the additional kick.

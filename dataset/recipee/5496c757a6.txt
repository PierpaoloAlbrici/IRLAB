Egg-Free! Silken Tofu and Okara Baked Donuts


Ingredients


 - 100 g of tofu, raw, regular, prepared with calcium sulfate


 - 60 g of okara


 - 40 g of pancakes, plain, dry mix, complete (includes buttermilk)


 - 5 g of oil, canola


 - 20 g of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Mash the tofu and set aside. Then, crumble the fresh okara. Combine the crumbled tofu and okara with the pancake mix, and add the oil and salt. Mix well. Pour the batter into donut molds and bake in an oven for 20 minutes at 180C. Once baked, leave in the molds to cool completely before removing. This makes them extra-moist!

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of seeds, pumpkin and squash seeds, whole, roasted, without salt

 - 4 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, cloves, ground

 - 1/8 teaspoon of spices, cardamom

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

Place pumpkin seeds, water, and salt in a saucepan, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to medium; boil seeds for 10 minutes. Drain seeds but do not rinse. Pat seeds dry with paper towels and spread out onto a work surface or a baking sheet for 30 minutes to dry. Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Melt butter in a large microwave-safe bowl until melted, about 1 minute. Toss seeds in the melted butter and mix in 1 tablespoon sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and cardamom; toss again to coat seeds thoroughly with spices. Spread seeds out onto the prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Bake in the preheated oven until toasted and crunchy, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Stir several times during baking. Sprinkle toasted seeds with 1 tablespoon sugar or as desired; cool before serving.

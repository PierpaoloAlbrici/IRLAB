Quick Yogurt Bread


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Preheat your oven to 200 C (395 F). Sift the flour, salt and baking powder into a large bowl and make a little well in the middle. Pour in the yogurt and oil and stir it up, using a wooden spoon, until well blended. Grease a 23 cm (9-inch) baking pan (or line it with baking paper), pour in the batter (it will be very thick) and level the top. Bake the bread in a preheated oven, for about 25 minutes, or until golden. As soon as you take it out of the oven, brush the surface with a tablespoon of butter, for a softer crust (optional). Let it stand for a few minutes and serve.

Simple Honey Mustard Sauce/Dressing


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular


 - 12 cup of honey


 - 14 cup of mustard, prepared, yellow


Instructions: 

Mix all three ingredients together until thoroughly combined. Hints - Low fat or reduced fat mayo is fine to use - it's all that I usually have in the house. Warm the honey for a few seconds in the microwave. It will make it much easier to combine. * For quick scaling, use 4 parts mayo, 2 parts honey, 1 part mustard. Frequently I'll use 2 tablespoons mayo, 1 tablespoon honey, 1/2 tablespoon (1 1/2 teaspoons) mustard for 1-2 servings, or 4 tablespoons mayo, 2 tablespoons honey, and 1 tablespoon mustard for 2-3 generous servings.

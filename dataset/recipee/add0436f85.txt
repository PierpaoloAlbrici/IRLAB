Kielbasa Hash


Ingredients


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 18 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 24 ounce of sweet potato, raw, unprepared


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 6 2/3 ounce of carrots, raw


 - 12 1/2 ounce of onions, raw


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, marjoram, dried


 - 78 ounce of spices, garlic powder


 - 12 tablespoon of oil, canola


 - 13 ounce of ground turkey, raw


 - 13 ounce of brussels sprouts, raw


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

In a large skillet over high heat melt the butter in the grapeseed oil. When it is melted and starting to bubble, add the black pepper and sweet potato pieces and saute for about 5-10 minutes until the potatoes soften and start to brown. Add the olive oil, onion, carrot, marjoram, and red chili flakes. Toss to combine with the potatoes and continue over high heat until the onions turn translucent and brown around the edges. About 8 minutes into this process, add the minced garlic and cook until the onions finish browning. This whole process will take about 10-15 minutes. Remove, scraping all remnants from the bottom of the skillet, and set aside in a bowl. Add canola oil to the skillet and reduce the heat to medium. Add the kielbasa and brussels sprouts. Saute until both the meat and brussels sprouts start to brown. Add the potato, carrot, and onion mixture back to the skillet and fold to combine. Season with the salt. Cook for 2-3 more minutes, stirring to prevent burning and to blend flavors. Remove from heat and serve.

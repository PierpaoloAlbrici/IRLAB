Whole Wheat Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 34 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Cut the butter or margarine into the dry ingredients with a fork or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Stir in the milk a small bit at a time, adding just enough so that the dough rounds up and leaves the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll it out until it is 1/2-inch thick. Then with a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter, cut out the biscuits and place them on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or stick a tooth pick in the center. If it comes out clean and not gooey that means they are done. Serve hot with butter or jam. Enjoy.

Grape Jam in a Pressure Cooker


Ingredients


 - 300 g of grapes, red or green (european type, such as thompson seedless), raw


 - 240 g of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Rinse the grapes, cut in halves, remove the seeds, and weigh (to calculate how much sugar you need). Put the grapes and sugar into a pressure cooker and let it sit until the sugar dissolves. Once the sugar dissolves, cover with a lid, and cook on high heat. Cook for 5 minutes after the pressure gauge rises, then remove from heat and steam for 5 more minutes. Let the pressure out, open the lid, then simmer for a while. Pour it into a jar while still hot.

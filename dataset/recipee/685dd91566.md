### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 8 tablespoon of nuts, walnuts, english

### Instructions

Mix brown sugar, butter, flour, and crushed walnuts together like a pie crust. Form into two rolls. Wrap and place in freezer until firm enough (sounds like an overnight in refrigerator cookie to me). Cut rolls into thin slices the same width. Bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 5 minutes. After cookies are cooled, roll in sugar and crushed walnuts.

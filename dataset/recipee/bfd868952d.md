[bfd868952d](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/fig-jam-379680)

### Ingredients

 - 3 pound of figs, dried, uncooked

 - 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 3 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1/4 cup of lemon juice, raw

### Instructions

Place the figs in a large pot or a Dutch oven and add the water. Cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then decrease the heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook until the figs are completely soft and tender, about 15 minutes. In a food processor fitted with the metal blade or in a blender, puree the figs and their cooking liquid (if using a blender, dont fill the jar more than halfway, as the hot liquid might burst through the top when the blender is turned on). Or, pass the figs through a food mill. Return the puree to the pot. Stir in the sugar and lemon juice. Cook over medium heat until thickened, stirring constantly to prevent the mixture from burning on the bottom, until the jam is thick appears slightly jelled. (Because figs are low in pectin, the wrinkle test, page 256, wont work with this jam.) Ladle the jam into clean jars. Cover tightly, let cool, and refrigerate. The jam will keep for at least 6 months in the refrigerator. Before ladling into jars, stir in 1/2 cup (80 g) coarsely chopped Soft-Candied Citrus Peel (page 253) made with lemons.

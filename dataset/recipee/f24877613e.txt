Add blueberries and 1/2 cup milk to a blender; blend until fairly smooth, scraping down the sides as necessary. Blend in the lemon juice and salt; set aside. Warm the remaining 1 1/4 cups milk in a medium saucepan over low heat. Stir in the sugar until dissolved; cool 5 minutes. Pour into the blender with the blueberry puree; blend until smooth. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl; refrigerate until well chilled, for at least 4 hours or overnight. Freeze in your ice cream machine according to manufacturers instructions.

### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of watermelon, raw

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 cup of alcoholic beverage, distilled, rum, 80 proof

### Instructions

Blend watermelon in a blender until smooth. At this point, you may want to strain it through a wire mesh stainer and discard the solids, but I kinda like the pulp. Mix in water and Malibu. Pour into a pretty pitcher and serve.

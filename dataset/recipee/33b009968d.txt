Cheesy Pizza Scrolls


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 1/2 cup of tomato sauce, canned, no salt added


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, oregano, dried


 - 1 cup of cheese, cheddar


 - 1/2 cup of spinach, raw


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 390 degrees. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and place the buttermilk in the well; mix to form a soft dough. Turn dough onto a floured surface and knead until smooth. Roll out to a 12 square. Place the tomato sauce and oregano in a bowl and mix to combine. Spread the tomato sauce mixture over the dough and sprinkle with spinach and cheese. Roll to enclose the filling. Slice the roll into 9 to 10 pieces and place side-by-side in a lightly greased 8x8 pan lined with parchment paper. You can sprinkle with additional cheese if you like. Bake the scrolls for 25-30 minutes or until golden. Serve warm with a side of tomato sauce.

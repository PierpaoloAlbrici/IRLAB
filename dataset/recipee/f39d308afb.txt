Beef Jerky II


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of beef, flank, steak, separable lean and fat, trimmed to 0" fat, all grades, cooked, broiled


 - 4 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 4 tablespoon of sauce, worcestershire


 - 1 tablespoon of catsup


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Remove fat from meat and place [meat] in freezer. When semi-frozen, it is easily cut into 3/8- or 1/4-inch strips (the thinner the slices, the faster the drying). Note: meat cut with grain will be chewy, against grain, tender. Combine everything in large bowl. Marinate meat 1 hour with sauce in refrigerator, then drain in colander. Place meat on cookie sheets to dry. For fastest drying do not overlap meat and turn at least once during drying. Dry in 145-degree oven [I use 155 degrees - Tom] for 8 to 10 hours on cookie sheets. It is ready when it bends like a green willow without breaking. Refrigerate for long-term storage.

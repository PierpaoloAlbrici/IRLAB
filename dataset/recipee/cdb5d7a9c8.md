### Ingredients

 - 9 ounce of sugars, granulated

 - 4 fl. oz of water, bottled, generic

 - 3 1/2 fl. oz of honey

### Instructions

Put all the ingredients into a heavy based pan, and heat gently until the sugar dissolves. Bring to the boil and boil rapidly until the syrup reaches the soft crack stage, or 145oC (290oF), measured on a sugar thermometer. Pour onto a greased marble slab and allow to cool until lukewarm, pulling the edges towards the centre, so they don't become too hard. With greased hands, pull and stretch the taffy, until it becomes light in colour, and more elastic. Form a rope, and cut into pieces with shap kitchen scissors or a heavy knife. Wrap in clingfilm or waxed paper.

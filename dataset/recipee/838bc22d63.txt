Paletas de Sandia


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 1/2 pound of watermelon, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of lime juice, raw


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


Instructions: 

Combine the water and sugar in a small saucepan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring, until the mixture comes to a boil and the sugar has dissolved. Let cool to room temperature. Pour the syrup into a blender. Add the watermelon, lime juice, and salt and blend until smooth. If using conventional molds, divide the mixture among the molds, snap on the lid, and freeze until solid, about 5 hours. If using glasses or other unconventional molds, freeze until the pops are beginning to set (1 1/2 to 2 hours), then insert the sticks and freeze until solid, 4 to 5 hours. If using an instant ice pop maker, follow the manufacturers instructions.

Fresh Raspberry Sauce


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 pound of raspberries, raw


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

Combine raspberries, sugar, water, and lemon juice in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until raspberries break down, sugar dissolves, and sauce is heated through, 3 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and press sauce through a fine-mesh strainer to remove seeds. Cool to room temperature, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until chilled, at least 45 minutes.

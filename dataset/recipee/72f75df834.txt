 - 2 1/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 14 cup of honey


 - 14 cup of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 34 cup of raisins, seeded


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of oats


Instructions: 

In your mixer, combine 1 1/2 cup bread flour, yeast, cinnamon, and salt. Heat water, honey and maple syrup in a saucepan over low heat until it reaches 120-130 degrees. Using low speed, slowly add water mixture to flour mixture. Mix on medium speed until there are no lumps, about 2-3 minutes. With your mixer on low speed, add wheat flour and oatmeal half a cup at a time. Then add remaining bread flour half a cup at a time until dough clears the side of the bowl. Dough will be sticky. Turn onto a floured surface and knead until dough is smooth (apx 5 minutes) adding the raisins as you go along. Add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time as necessary. Turn into oiled bowl and flip dough so that top of dough is oiled. Cover and let rise until double, approximately 60-90 minutes. Using lightly oiled hands, turn out dough and shape into 2 small round loaves and place on greased baking sheet OR 1 large loaf and place in 9x5 bread ban, cover and let rise 60-90 minutes. If you like a softer crust, brush tops of loaves with oil. Preheat oven to 375 degrees and bake for 40-45 minutes. Check bread after 30 minutes and cover with foil if its getting too dark on top. If making two smaller loaves, they may be done sooner. Remove bread from pans and cool completely on a wire rack.

### Ingredients

 - 12 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 1 cup of onions, raw

 - 1/2 cup of peppers, sweet, green, raw

 - 1 pound of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 32 ounce of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry

 - 15 ounce of tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average

 - 14 ounce of tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average

 - 15 ounce of beans, snap, green, raw

 - 15 ounce of beans, kidney, all types, mature seeds, raw

 - 15 ounce of beans, snap, green, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, cumin seed

### Instructions

Cook tortellini according to package directions, usually about 10 minutes. Rinse with cool water and drain. Set aside. In a large cast iron Dutch oven over medium heat, saute onion and pepper for 5 minutes. Then add beef, salt and pepper and garlic powder and stir and cook until beef is browned. Drain off some of the grease if necessary, but not too much. I like the flavor it adds! Add broth, tomatoes, the cans of beans (dont drain them) and cumin. Rapidly boil mixture until liquid is reduced by half. Add cooked tortellini and keep warm until ready to serve. Garnish with sour cream and shredded cheese if youd like.

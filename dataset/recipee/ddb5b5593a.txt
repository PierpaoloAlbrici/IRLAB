Chinese Sticky Chicken


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of spices, garlic powder


 - 14 cup of cornstarch


 - 2 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 2 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw


 - 14 cup of oil, canola


Instructions: 

In a large bowl, whisk crouton crumbs and cornstarch. Stir in the soy sauce. Add chicken and toss until completely coated. Cover; refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook, covered, for 20 to 25 minutes until nice and crispy and cooked through. Turn about 4 or 5 times during cooking to avoid burning. Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately with additional soy sauce, chopped scallions, cooked rice and steamed sugar snap peas, if desired.

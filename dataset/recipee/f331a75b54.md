### Ingredients

 - 2 pound of bacon, meatless

 - 34 cup of sugars, brown

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, cardamom

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and another rack in the lowest third. Preheat to 350 degrees. Line the bottom and sides of two rimmed baking sheets with foil. Arrange the bacon slices in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. In a small bowl, toss together the seasonings. Sprinkle evenly over the bacon. Place one pan on the upper rack and the other pan on the lower rack. Bake, without turning, for 20 to 25 minutes. Switch the position of the pans, top to bottom and front to back. Continue to bake until dark brown but not quite crisp, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Using tongs, lift the bacon from the pans, gently shaking off excess drippings. Transfer to paper towels to drain briefly. Arrange the bacon on a warmed platter and serve at once.

### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 3 cup of blackberries, raw

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Dice up butter and put it in the baking dish. Place it in the oven to melt while you mix the rest of your ingredients. Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, lemon juice and milk together. It might look a bit lumpy. Pour the batter into the baking dish after the butter has melted. Pour blackberries over the batter. Dont stir it together! Bake for about 30-40 minutes, depending on your oven. The top will get golden brown and start to pull away from the sides of the dish. Serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

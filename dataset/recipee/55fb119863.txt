Oatmeal Cookies (Raw Vegan)


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of oats


 - 12 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 12 cup of raisins, seeded


 - 12 cup of sweetener, syrup, agave


 - 14 cup of nuts, cashew nuts, raw


Instructions: 

Put oat groats in food processor and grind until fine. Transfer to a mixing bowl. Put almonds in food processor and pulse a few times to chop them until just coarsely chopped. Transfer to bowl with the oats. Add raisins and agave nectar to bowl and mix everything well. Grind cashews in coffee grinder, and use this to coat your palms as you handle the cookie batter. Take small chunks of dough and flatten into rounds on the mesh sheet of a dehydrator tray. Dehydrate for about 12 hours on 110 degrees. Dehydrating time needed will vary according to how thick you've made the cookies, and the desired chewy/crunchy-ness. :).

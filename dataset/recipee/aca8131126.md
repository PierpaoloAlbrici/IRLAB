### Ingredients

 - 1 quart of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat

 - 1 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1/4 cup of orange juice, raw

 - 1/2 cup of goji berries, dried

 - 1 teaspoon of nuts, pine nuts, dried

### Instructions

Strain the yogurt for 12-24 hours in a cheesecloth-lined strainer. It will drain away about 1/2 its volume in clear yellow liquid, leaving you with thick, magical, wonderful, richly creamy stuff called yogurt cheese. It will be quite stiff so beat it until smooth with wire whisk or mixer. Add milk, honey, vanilla, and orange juice concentrate and beat until smooth. Layer your yogurt creme in a pretty glass with fresh fruit or berries, toasted nuts, etc....or enjoy it all by itself. Mmm.... Click on Related Blog Post for detailed photos!

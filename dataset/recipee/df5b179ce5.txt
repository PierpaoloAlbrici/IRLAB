Sticky Rice


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


Instructions: 

Rinse the rice, then soak it in water to cover for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. Drain, then wrap in cheesecloth and put in a steamer above boiling water. Steam for about 30 minutes, until tender. Making a good thing better: Toss the cooked rice with 1 cup coconut milk, homemade (page 584) or canned, and 1 tablespoon nam pla (Thai fish sauce; see page 500). Rewrap and steam (or microwave) for 5 more minutes to reheat.

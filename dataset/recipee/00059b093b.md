### Ingredients

 - 3 pound of chicken, broilers or fryers, wing, meat and skin, raw

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1/4 cup of sauce, hot chile, sriracha

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

 - 1 tablespoon of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

 - 1 teaspoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

 - 1 teaspoon of sauce, hoisin, ready-to-serve

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, coriander seed

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a large bowl, toss the wings with salt and pepper and oil. Line a sheet pan with nonstick foil or parchment paper, and spread the wings evenly on the pan. Bake for about 50 minutes, turning the wings halfway through. In the last couple of minutes, you can turn on the broiler to get them to really crisp up. Keep an eye on them, though! When the wings are done, melt the butter in a skillet or wok and add the Sriracha, honey, rice wine, soy sauce, hoisin, and salt. Stir over low heat until bubbly. Transfer the wings from the baking sheet into the pan with the sauce. Toss until coated. Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve immediately.

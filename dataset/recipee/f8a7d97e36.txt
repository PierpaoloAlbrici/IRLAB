Jane's Non-Fat Whole Wheat Bread (Using Food Processor)


Ingredients


 - 2 1/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 3-4 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 1 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 2 tablespoon of vital wheat gluten


Instructions: 

Proof yeast in warm water. Add brown sugar, salt and applesauce to yeast. Place flours and wheat gluten into the bowl of a large food processor. (Check your food processor manual to make sure your processor is powerful enough to process bread dough and to determine how much flour your processor can handle. If necessary, process this recipe in two batches). I use a 14 cup Cuisinart processor. If you use regular white flour instead of bread flour, add an additional 2 tablespoons of wheat gluten. If you want to use all whole wheat flour, add 4 to 6 more Tablespoons of wheat gluten. (Note: vital wheat gluten is available in bulk or boxes at health food stores). Start processor and slowly pour liquid through the feed tube. You may need more or less liquid depending on the type of flour and the humidity. Within about 30 to 60 seconds the mixture should form a ball. If it doesn't, add more water or flour (whichever is necessary) for the dough to form a ball. After the dough forms a ball, process for an additional 30 to 60 seconds until smooth and elastic. Do not overprocess because processing causes the dough to heat up and it might heat up so much that you kill the yeast. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board and form into a ball. This is your opportunity to ensure that the dough has the proper ratio of flour to liquid. Place dough into a lightly oiled bowl and turn to coat the surface of the dough with the oil. Cover with kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rise in warm place until doubled. Turn risen dough out onto lightly floured board and knead a few times. Cut dough in half and let rest for 10 minutes. Roll half of dough into a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Turn board so long edge of rectangle is facing you. Fold right half over middle and press with fingers to seal. Fold left half over middle (so the "new rectangle" is as wide as your bread pan) and seal. Roll (beginning at narrow side) tightly, pressing with fingers to seal well. Pinch ends and tuck under loaf. Place in a greased loaf pan (8 inches by 4 1/4 inches by 2 1/2 inces). Oil the top of the loaf. Cover with a kitchen towel or loose plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled. Bake at 325 degrees F until done. This takes about 27 minutes in my oven. Turn out and let cool on a rack.

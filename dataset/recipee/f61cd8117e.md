 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray an 8x8 pan. Cream the butter in a large bowl; while still beating, stream in the honey. Mix in the applesauce. Combine the dry ingredients and mix into the applesauce mixture and beat 30 seconds. Fold in the nuts and raisins. Bake 40 minutes or until the cake springs back in the center and a toothpick comes out clean. While the cake is baking, prepare the raisin glaze. In a saucepan, combine the water and chopped raisins. Bring to a boil; add honey, reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes. Remove from heat and add lemon juice. While cake is still warm, pierce cake with a fork (the end of a wooden spoon is too large). Spoon the glaze over the cake.

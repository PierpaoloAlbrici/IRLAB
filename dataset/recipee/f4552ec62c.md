### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of syrup, maple, canadian

 - 5 tablespoon of nuts, pecans

 - 1 cup of pancakes, plain, dry mix, complete (includes buttermilk)

 - 23 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 13 cup of pumpkin, raw

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 18 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

### Instructions

For pecan syrup: Combine the maple syrup and pecans in a small microwave safe bowl. Heat in microwave until hot, about 25 seconds. Set the pecan syrup aside and keep warm. For pancakes: Whisk pancake mix, water, pumpkin, cinnamon and ginger in a medium bowl until just blended (do not overmix, the mixture should be lumpy). Spray a heavy griddle with nonstick spray and heat over medium heat. Spoon 2 Tbsp of batter onto griddle to form each pancake. Cook for 2 minutes or until bubbles appear, then turn pancakes over and cook 2 minutes longer. Transfer pancakes to plate. Top with butter and serve with warm pecan syrup.

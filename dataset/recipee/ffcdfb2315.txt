Blueberry Oat Squares - Starbucks Copycat


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of oats


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of sugars, brown


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 34 cup of butter, without salt


 - 3 cup of blueberries, raw


 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 13 cup of orange juice, raw


 - 4 teaspoon of cornstarch


Instructions: 

Filling: In saucepan, bring blueberries, sugar and orange juice to boil; reduce heat and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes. Whisk in cornstarch and boil, stirring, until thickened, about 1 minute. Place plastic wrap directly on surface; refrigerate until cooled, about 1 hour or up to 1 day before using. Base/Topping: In a large bowl, stir together the oats, flour, brown sugar, salt and baking soda. Cut in the butter to form a crumbly mixture. Reserve 1 1/2 cups of the crumbs, and pat the rest evenly into the bottom of a greased 9 x 13 inch pan. Spread the blueberry mixture over the base. Crumble the reserved amount of the base/topping over the blueberry mixture. Bake at 350 degrees F until light golden, about 40-45 minutes. Let cool completely on rack as these cut better when they are fully set. (Make-ahead: Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days or overwrap with heavy-duty foil and freeze for up to 2 weeks. ).

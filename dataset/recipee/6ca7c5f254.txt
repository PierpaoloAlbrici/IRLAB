Strawberry Yogurt Scones


Ingredients


 - 1 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1/4 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1/2 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


 - 2 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Sift the flour and baking powder into a large bowl. Using your fingers, rub in the butter until the mixture resembles a crumbly texture. Add the yogurt all at once and mix briefly to form a soft dough. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1 inch in thickness. Dip a 3-inch cutter into some flour, and stamp out 12 scones. (You may have to re-roll the dough to get 12.) Place scones 2 inches apart onto baking sheets. Brush tops with milk. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes or until risen and golden brown. Best served freshly baked with butter.

Homemade Ricotta


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

Line a strainer with a couple layers of damp paper towel or cheesecloth, and set inside a large bowl. In a saucepan, combine heavy cream, milk, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium high heat. Once boiling, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vinegar or lemon juice. Let the mixture sit for 2 minutes, then pour into the strainer and let drain for 20 minutes. Its ready for use! Note: Because there are no stabilizers, a little liquid will always pool on the sides. Just stir it in.

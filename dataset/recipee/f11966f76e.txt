Place the sugar in a shallow bowl, and set aside. Combine the vanilla wafer crumbs, confectioners' sugar, and pecans in a bowl, and mix well. Place the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl, and microwave on High for 1 to 2 minutes to melt the chips. Stir the melted chips until smooth, and beat in the corn syrup and whiskey.

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 3/4 cup of lentils, raw

 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1/4 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard

### Instructions

Bring water to a boil. Add red lentils and let them simmer until just tender, about 20 minutes. You dont want to overcook your red lentils or they will turn to mush. Add more water, in 1/4-cup increments, as needed, if the water absorbs before the lentils are done. You dont want them to dry out while cooking. Once your water is absorbed and lentils are tender, remove from the heat and stir in butter. Season with salt and pepper. Add in parmesan cheese. Serve.

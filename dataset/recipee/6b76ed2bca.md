### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of olives, ripe, canned (small-extra large)

 - 2 tablespoon of shallots, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, rosemary, dried

 - 1 pound of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 1 tablespoon of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow

 - 4 tablespoon of tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average

 - 2 4 ounce of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw

 - 2 ounce of cheese, feta

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a small bowl combine olives, shallots, garlic and rosemary. On a floured surface press out dough to a rectangle, 3/4-inch thick. Sprinkle olive mixture onto surface of dough. Fold sides in to hold mixture. Beginning with end nearest you, roll dough up tightly. Transfer carefully to a cornmeal-dusted baking sheet. Cover and set aside in a warm place until it doubles in size, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Bake until bread is deep golden brown and an instant-reading thermometer inserted in bread registers 190 degrees. Let cool completely on a wire rack before slicing. For each sandwich, spread 2 bread slices with sundried tomato paste, top with beef slices and sprinkle with feta. Serve garnished with some whole olives.

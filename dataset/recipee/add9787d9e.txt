Vegan Pumpkin Scones


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 3 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 3 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 12 cup of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


 - 2 cup of pumpkin, raw


Instructions: 

In a large mixing bowl, combine dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and ginger). Cut in margarine, adding a bit at a time until mixed. Add pumpkin and combine well. On a lightly floured surface, knead dough a few times, pushing it into a large circle, a few inches thick. Cut into 12 or so triangular pieces. Imagine you are cutting a pizza so that you get even, triangular slices. Bake at 425 degrees for 12-15 minutes, or until done.

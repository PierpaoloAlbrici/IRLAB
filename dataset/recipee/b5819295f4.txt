 - 2 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 cup of seeds, flaxseed


 - 4 tablespoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, poppy seed


 - 14 cup of seeds, flaxseed


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 4 tablespoon of honey

Instructions: 

Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup of the warm water. Let stand for 5-10 minutes. (You can add a pinch of sugar to aid the yeast.) Combine flours, seeds, salt and flax meal. Pour remaining 2 cups of warm water, honey and oil in a large bowl. Add the yeast and then two cups of the flour/seed mixture. Stir until you have a ragged dough. At this point you can start kneading your dough. Add the remaining flour/seed mixture 1- 1 1/2 cups at a time until you have all of it kneaded together evenly. Place the bread dough in an oiled bowl. Cover with wax paper sprayed with oil and a damp tea towel. Place in a warm spot for 1- 1 1/2 hours or until it has doubled in size. Punch the dough down and divide in two equal portions. Shape each portion into a bun and place each into an oiled bread pan. Cover these with the waxed paper and tea towel. Let rise for an additional 20 minutes. Place loaves in a preheated 450 degree oven. After 10 minutes, reduce to 350 degrees and bake for an additional 30 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on a rack.

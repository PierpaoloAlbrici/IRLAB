### Ingredients

 - 10 pound of potatoes, raw, skin

 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 6 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 3 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, paprika

 - 6 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 10 ounce of cheese, cheddar

### Instructions

Place potatoes in a greased 4 quart casserole. Shred cheese. Melt butter in saucepan. Mix flour, salt, dry mustard, cayenne, pepper and paprika; add to melted butter. Cook, stirring with whisk constantly, until bubbly. Add milk and continue stirring until mixture starts to become thick. Begin adding shredded cheese by the handful, stirring all the while. Continue cooking and stirring until mixture has boiled about 5 minutes (to cook flour, to prevent a "floury" taste). Pour cheese sauce over potatoes. Bake at 450 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes to 1 hour, until bubbly and beginning to brown on top.

Creamy Ravioli and Broccoli


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of broccoli, raw


 - 12 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 12 cup of cheese, ricotta, whole milk


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 tablespoon of bacon, meatless


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 25 ounce of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw


Instructions: 

Bring 2 1/2 quarts of unsalted water to a boil in a covered large pot. Meanwhile, combine the parmesan, ricotta, oil, bacon bits and red pepper flakes. Stir well to mix; set aside. When water in pot reaches a rapid boil, add the broccoli and ravioli. Cover and bring the water back to a boil. Crack the lid and cook at a medium boil until the pasta is tender, about 5 minutes. When pasta is done, drain it along with the broccoli. Add the cheese mixture and toss to coat. Enjoy!

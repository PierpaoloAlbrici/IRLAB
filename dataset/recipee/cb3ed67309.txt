Two Ingredient Chocolate Mousse


Ingredients


 - 7 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 23 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 18 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Put water and chocolate into a medium saucepan over medium-low heat and whisk until chocolate is melted. Once homogeneous, pour the mixture into a bowl resting in a shallow pan filled with ice cubes to chill. Whisk the mixture until it thickens (if using an electric mixer, watch carefully because it will thicken much quicker). Once the consistency resembles that of whipped cream, dish into ramekins and either serve immediately or refrigerate until serving. If the consistency is off, just melt and start over again.

Cashew Brittle


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of syrups, corn, light


 - 1 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 cup of nuts, cashew nuts, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Line a nonstick sheet pan with parchment or a silicone mat, and set aside. Heat the corn syrup, sugar, and salt in a medium saucepan set over medium-high heat. Cook until the temperature reaches 310 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Once the mixture reaches 310 degrees F, remove from the stove; quickly add the baking soda, cashews, and butter, and keep stirring constantly. The mixture will stay opaque. Carefully pour the hot mixture onto the mat-or parchment-covered sheet pan, and spread across the pan with wooden spoon. Cool for 1 1/2 hours. Break into 2-inch pieces. A silicone mat works best to avoid a sticky clean-up; do not use waxed paper, which will melt and stick under the heat of the candy.

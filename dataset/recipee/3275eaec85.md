### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of quinoa, uncooked

 - 12 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 18 teaspoon of spices, cardamom

### Instructions

For those who are just getting started in how to cook with quinoa-- quinoa naturally comes with a bitter exterior called saponin. You NEED to properly rinse it before cooking with it! Don't give me a low score for bitter taste because you have to rinse it well first! Put the quinoa in a deep bowl and pour cold water over it. With a fork or whisk, stir it heavily for a couple minutes until a soapy residue is floating to the top. Strain it through a fine-mesh colander and rinse it under the tap again. Now your quinoa's ready for cooking! Bring 2 cups of water to a boil and add a little salt so the quinoa doesn't stick to the bottom. Add the olive oil and cardamom to the boiled water and let it impart for a few seconds. Add the rinsed quinoa and lower the heat to medium. Loosely cover the pot and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes or until all the quinoa pieces have fluffed out. Remove from the heat and let it stand for a few minutes, then fluff with a fork and serve.

Struan Muffins Recipe empresscrumb


Ingredients


 - 1 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of oats


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 3/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow


 - 2 tablespoon of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, poppy seed


 - 1/4 cup of jams and preserves, apricot


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 12-cup muffin pan. Whisk together the flour, oats, baking soda, salt, cornmeal, cooked rice, and brown sugar in a medium bowl. In a large measuring cup, beat together the buttermilk, oil, eggs and honey until well mixed. Gently fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and allow to sit for about 1 minute for ingredients to hydrate. Spoon into prepared muffin pan. For jam centers, spoon about 1 tablespoon of the batter into each muffin cup and drop a teaspoon of jam on top, then cover with the remaining batter. Sprinkle the tops with poppy seeds. Bake for 17-20 minutes, or until golden brown. Allow to cool in pan for 5 minutes before transferring the muffins to a rack to cool completely.

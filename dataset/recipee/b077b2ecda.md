### Ingredients

 - 34 pound of carrots, raw

 - 12 pound of radishes, raw

 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 teaspoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 1/4 cup of vinegar, distilled

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

Fill a canning jar with boiling water. Cover and set aside. Cut carrots and daikon into julienne. Place into a colander and sprinkle with salt and 2 tsp sugar. Knead and massage the vegetables for 3-4 minutes, until they expel liquid. When you can bend a piece of daikon into a circle without it breaking, you are ready to proceed. Rinse the vegetables in cool running water, then squeeze gently to expel any excess liquid. In a small pan, bring vinegar, water and 1/2 c sugar to a simmer. Drain the water from the jar, pack the vegetables into the jar and pour the simmering brine over the vegetables. Cover tightly. When it cools to room temperature, refrigerate. It will keep for up to a month.

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of oats

 - 1 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 12 cup of raisins, seeded

 - 14 cup of syrup, maple, canadian

 - 14 cup of soymilk, original and vanilla, unfortified

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

### Instructions

Soak oats overnight in the water if you want the oatmeal to be really nice & creamy. Bring all ingredients to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat and simmer till thick and creamy- this doesn't take long. Add more milk or water and cook longer if it isn't creamy enough for your taste. Serve immediately. Add any favorite nuts to each bowl if you like- I loved chopped almonds.

Sweet Potato Gnocchi


Ingredients


 - 1 1/3 pound of sweet potato, raw, unprepared


 - 1 cup of cheese, ricotta, whole milk


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


Instructions: 

In large saucepan, cook sweet potatoes, covered, in enough boiling salted water to cover for 25-35 minutes (until tender). Drain well; return to same pan. Over low heat, mash potatoes until smooth allowing any extra moisture to evaporate. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl. Stir in ricotta cheese, salt, nutmeg, and 1.5 cups of flour. On a well-floured surface, knead in the remaining .5 cup flour, kneading for 2-3 minutes or until a soft dough ball is formed. Divide into 8 pieces and roll each piece into a 12" long log (1" in diameter). Cut into 1" pieces & w/ a floured finger, make a dimple in the center of each piece. Boil a large pot of salted water. Cook gnocchi, in small batches for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to surface of water (Careful not to overcook). Remove w/ skimmer or slotted spoon & drain on paper towels or tea towel. Cover to warm while making rest of gnocchi.

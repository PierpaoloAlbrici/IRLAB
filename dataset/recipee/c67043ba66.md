### Ingredients

 - 34 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 cup of sugars, brown

 - 14 cup of butter, without salt

 - 4 cup of cherries, sweet, raw

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 4 tablespoon of cornstarch

 - 12 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 cup of oats

 - 12 cup of sugars, brown

 - 14 cup of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 375F. In a small mixing bowl, combine crust ingredients with a fork until mixture resembles wet sand. Press into the bottom and up the sides of a standard pie plate, using the back of a spoon or fingers. Combine filling ingredients in a large mixing bowl; set aside until juice begins to form (Note: If the cherries are especially juicy, add more cornstarch for thickening. Otherwise, the pie filling will not set up well). Pour cherry mixture into crust. In a small mixing bowl, combine topping ingredients until butter is thoroughly incorporated. With fingers, crumble atop cherry filling. Bake for 45-60 minutes or until topping is crispy and brown, and filling is bubbly. To allow the pie filling to set up well, cool for at least two hours on a wire rack. Cut into eight slices to serve. If desired, garnish each slice with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

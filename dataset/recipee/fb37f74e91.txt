Only 2 Ingredients Needed! Tofu Donuts


Ingredients


 - 200 g of pancakes, plain, dry mix, complete (includes buttermilk)


 - 200 g of tofu, raw, regular, prepared with calcium sulfate


Instructions: 

Add the tofu to the pancake mix. Use your hands and mix thoroughly. Form into small balls. If it's difficult to form, don't force it. You can also scoop up the dough or batter and drop it into the oil directly using a spoon. Heat some frying oil and deep-fry the donut balls. If the dough is too soft to form balls, use spoons to drop the dough directly into oil. Drain the fried donuts. Optionally coat with cinnamon sugar or kinako (toasted ground soybean flour) mixed in sugar. They're also good just plain! As long as the ratio of tofu to pancake mix is 1:1, you don't need to stick to the 200 g amount. When I made this the second time, I just had 135 g of tofu so I used 135 g of pancake mix.

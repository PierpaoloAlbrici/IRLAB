### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1/4 cup of lemon juice, raw

 - 3 tablespoon of honey

### Instructions

combine all ingredients in a saucepan. bring mixture to a boil on medium heat once the mixture is brought to a boil lower the heat let the mixture boil slowly for 20 minutes stirring every 5 minutes when your mixture turns a caramel color its done. take it off the heat. the mixture will start to thicken. optional: you can add essential oils if you want. you only need 2-3 drops. i like to use peppermint oil or grapefruit oil store your wax in a microwavable container and keep it in the frige for up to 2 weeks a few things you can do to make your own strips. you can cut wax paper into strips or you can use an old shirt and cut it up. i use paper towels cut up they work. i dont know about for cheap paper towels though *Wait until the wax is cold enough so you don't burn your skin. Use this recipe at your own risk.

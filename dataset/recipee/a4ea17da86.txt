Black Currant Refrigerator Jam


Ingredients


 - 12 1/2 ounce of currants, zante, dried


 - 9 tablespoon of sweetener, syrup, agave


 - 2 tablespoon of cornstarch


Instructions: 

Clean and remove stalks of black currants. Place currants in a large pot and add agave syrup. Use a potato masher to crush them a little. You definitely dont want a berry puree here, just partially mash to release some juice while keeping most of them intact. Mix well and let stand for about 1 hour. The mixture will become juicier during this time. Bring everything to a boil and let cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. In a small bowl, mix corn starch with some water for form a paste. Slowly pour into boiling jam, whisking constantly. Bring to a boil again and cook for 1 more minute. Let cool, transfer into a clean jar and refrigerate. Note: Use more or less sweetener to taste and more or less cornstarch according to the desired consistency.

Magnolia Vanilla Buttercream Frosting


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 6-8 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 12 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 1/2 cup of butter, without salt


 - 8-10 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 34 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Place the butter in a large mixing bowl. Add 4 cups of the sugar and then the milk and vanilla. On the medium speed of an electric mixer, beat until smooth and creamy, about 3-5 minutes. Gradually add the remaining sugar, 1 cup at a time, beating well after each addition (about 2 minutes), until the icing is thick enough to be of good spreading consistency. Note: You may not need to add all of the sugar.

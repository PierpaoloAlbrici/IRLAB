### Ingredients

 - 1 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 34 cup of sugars, brown

 - 12 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 2 tablespoon of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 14 cup of soymilk, original and vanilla, unfortified

 - 14 cup of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 1/2 cup of nuts, pecans

### Instructions

Throw everything but the pecans into a medium saucepan and stir well. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the syrup reaches 239F on a candy thermometer. Immediately remove from heat and continue whisking. Watch carefully, as the mixture cools, it will slowly begin to thicken and change, keep whisking. When it starts to cloud and feels like its starting to set up, stop whisking and stir in the pecans. Quickly drop by tablespoon onto parchment or a very well-greased cookie sheet, work fast because they firm up in no time. Allow to sit until firm, and enjoy the sugar rush.

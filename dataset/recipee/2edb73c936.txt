Amaranth Tortillas - Gluten Free


Ingredients


 - 1 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, chili powder


Instructions: 

In a small bowl, mix the amaranth flour and chili powder. Stir in water, then evaluate the consistency. The dough should be soft, but not wet, and mold easily into shapes. The dough will easily form a ball as you stir it. If necessary, add a bit more flour or water to achieve the proper consistency. Pinch off balls of dough the size of golf balls. Roll them in additional flour to coat well. Knead each ball a bit as you pat or roll it into a flat circle that's about 1/8" thick and 5" - 6" across. Repeat with all dough. Heat a heavy nonstick frying pan or griddle. Use no oil. Place each tortilla in the hot pan, and cook for a few minutes on each side. Tortillas should become lightly brown and start to appear dry. Cool on wire racks.

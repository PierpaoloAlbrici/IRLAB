### Ingredients

 - 1 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 3/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Put the flour into a medium bowl. Slowly drizzle in the boiling water and mix with a wooden spoon until the mixture just comes together. Turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until a smooth dough forms, 5 minutes. Return the dough to the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour or up to 4 hours. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and, using a sharp knife, cut it into 36 equal pieces (9 to 10 grams each). Roll each piece into a ball. Using a small, lightly floured rolling pin, roll out 1 ball of dough to a 1/8-inch-thick round, then roll out just the outer edge until it is 1/16 inch thick and the wrapper is 3 1/2 inches in diameter. (To hold the filling properly, the wrapper should be slightly thicker in the center than at the edge.) Transfer the wrapper to a parchment paperlined baking sheet and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining balls of dough.

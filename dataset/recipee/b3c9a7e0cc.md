### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of oat bran, raw

 - 2/3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1/8 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 6.0 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 3 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

Place the oats or oat bran, flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium-sized bowl, and stir to mix. Add the oil and just enough of the milk to form a stiff dough, stirring just until the mixture holds together and forms a ball. Coat two 12 inch x 12 inch pieces of waxed paper with nonstick cooking spray. Lay the dough on 1 of the sheets of waxed paper, and pat it into a 7-in. circle. Place the other sheet of paper over the circle of dough and, using a rolling pin, roll the dough into an 11-in. circle. Coat a 9 inch deep dish pie pan with nonstick cooking spray. Carefully peel the waxed paper from the crust and press the crust into the pie pan. Pinch the edges of the crust or press with the tines of a fork to make a decorative edge (As an alternative, you can also pat the crust into the pan. Pinch off pieces of dough and press them in a thin layer against the sides of the pan. Then fill in the bottom with the remaining dough). For a prebaked crust, prick the crust with a fork at 1-in. intervals, and bake at 400 degrees (200 C.) for about 12 minutes, or until lightly browned. Allow the crust to cool to room temperature before filling. When a prebaked crust is not desired, simply fill and bake as directed in the pie recipe.

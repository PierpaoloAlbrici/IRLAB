Tropical Baked Chicken


Ingredients


 - 3 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw


 - 4 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


 - 12 cup of onions, raw


 - 14 cup of peppers, sweet, green, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, basil, dried


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, paprika


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1 cup of orange juice, raw


 - 12 cup of pineapple juice, canned or bottled, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid


 - 14 cup of sugars, brown


Instructions: 

Position rack in the center of the oven. Preheat oven to 350F. Mix together Dijon mustard, basil and honey. Smear the chicken with this mixture. Arrange chicken, skin side down, in a shallow roasting pan or baking dish just large enough to hold it in a single layer. Sprinkle the pieces with finely chopped onions, bell peppers, butter, salt and freshly-ground pepper to taste and 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon and paprika. Pour orange and pineapple juice around the chicken. Bake, basting once, for 30 minutes. Turn the chicken skin side up, season with salt and pepper, 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon and paprika, and all of brown sugar. Bake until the chicken is tender and golden, about 20 minutes longer. Add more orange juice or pineapple juice if the pan seems dry. Pour the juice into a small saucepan and boil over high heat until it becomes syrupy. Spoon the sauce over the chicken and serve.

Sugar & Spice Roasted Pumpkin Seeds


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of seeds, pumpkin and squash seeds, whole, roasted, without salt


 - 5 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of pumpkin, raw


 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. On foil lined cookie sheet (I fold up all four sides of foil to form a lip so they don't slide off), spread out seeds in a single layer. Toast in oven for 45-50 minutes, stirring several times until seeds are dry & starting to brown. When seeds are toasted, melt butter in a large skillet over med-high heat. Add seeds & 2 Tablespoons of the sugar. Stir until sugar is melted. About 1 minute. In medium sized mixing bowl, stir together the remaining 3 Tablespoons of sugar with the salt & pumpkin pie spice. Add pumpkin seeds from skillet to mixing bowl & stir until coated.

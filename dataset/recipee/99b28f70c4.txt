Tip back out on a clean surface and knead for another 5mins Roll the dough into a long sausage shape and cut into even sized pieces. Roll in each one into a ball. Punch a whole in the middle with you finger and then spin the dough around your finger to create a ring shape. Heat oil in a large pot or in a deep fryer. Once it reaches around 160C. Gently place the doughnut rings in using a metal slotted spoon. Once one side is golden brown, turn them and cook on the other side. Once both sides are golden in colour, remove and place on a plate with kitchen paper on. Repeat for all your doughnut rings. Whilst still warm roll the rings in a bowl of caster sugar.

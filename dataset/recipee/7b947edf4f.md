### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of oats

 - 34 cup of oat bran, raw

 - 34 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 12 cup of seeds, sunflower seed kernels, dried

 - 2 tablespoon of wheat germ, crude

 - 1/2-2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

### Instructions

Place all ingredients in a large ziplock bag. Crush with a rolling pin into coarse crumbs, no need to be to fussy here. Shake to blend: store in bag or other airtight container at room temperature. To serve: at night place 1/3 cup mixture with 1/3 cup milk (I use skim) in frig. At this point, I also add 1/2 cup frozen blueberries, too. Read on and use your imagination. In the morning stir in 1/3 cup of preferred yogurt. I warm in the microwave 1 1/2 - 2 minutes before adding the yogurt.

Greek Hot Dog Sauce


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw


 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 2 teaspoon of onions, raw


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, oregano, dried


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, paprika


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, chili powder


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cumin seed


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, cloves, ground


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Put the all ingredients in a saucepan and add all spices. Before heating, stir into a paste. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for one hour or until liquid is reduced to your liking. If you use very lean meat to avoid cholesterol, add a tablespoon or two vegetable oil (I don't suggest olive oil). Its the oil that brings the flavor to the tongue!

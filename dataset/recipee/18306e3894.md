### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of blueberries, raw

 - 23 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 tablespoon of cornstarch

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Combine all ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir until mixture begins to heat up and dissolve, then use a potato masher to crush blueberries and release their natural juices. Reduce heat and cook until almost boiling, and sauce is to the consistency of your liking (generally, if it coats the back of a spoon). Serve immediately.

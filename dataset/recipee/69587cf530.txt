Instructions: 

Turn oven on to 375 degrees. Heat Oil on med-high in a large pan with a tightly fitted lid thats oven safe. (Dutch Oven). Saute onions and chicken till chicken is completely white, add garlic and cook for another minute or so. Add rice and lemon pepper seasoning and stir well for 1 minute. Add chicken broth and lemon juice and bring to boil. Cover tightly with lid and place on a rack in the middle of your oven, bake for 30-40 minutes stirring once about 15 min into baking. Bake covered until all the juice is evaporated and the rice is dry and fluffy. Enjoy! *You may add as much lemon pepper seasoning as your little heart desires, I tend to add a lot for the spicy tanginess! **Also I like to add veggies before adding the chicken broth and bringing to a boil, I like whole frozen green beans or broccoli. ***Sometimes I make it without the chicken as a side dish to meals as well.

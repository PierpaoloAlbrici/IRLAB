Dinner Rolls in One Hour


Ingredients


 - 2 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 3/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 5 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 34 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

In either a food processor or mixing bowl, mix the flour, yeast, milk, sugar, and salt. Add the water and oil and stir or process until a thick, sticky dough forms. Let stand for 5 minutes. Butter an 8-inch round cake pan. Place the dough on a lightly floured board. Gather the dough together gently. Using a floured knife or dough scraper, cut the dough into quarters. Cut each quarter into quarters, and shape each into balls, adding flour, if necessary, to prevent stickiness. Place the dough pieces close together in the prepared pan. Cover, and let rise in a warm place for 20 to 25 minutes or until the rolls are puffy. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Drizzle the melted butter over the rolls. Bake for 20 minutes or until golden.

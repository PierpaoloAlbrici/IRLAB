### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 3 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 34 cup of mango nectar, canned

 - 12 cup of apricots, dried, sulfured, uncooked

 - 1 tablespoon of vinegar, cider

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, chili powder

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

### Instructions

Measure flour into a food processor. Cut cream cheese and butter into large chunks and add; process just until mixture starts to hold together. Empty mixture into a bowl and knead lightly, pressing dough into a disc. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least one hour (or up to 2 days). In a small saucepan, bring 1 cup water to a boil. Remove from heat, add mangoes, cover, and allow to soak for 15 minutes. Add remaining ingredients and return to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally and mashing any large pieces of mango with the back of a spoon or fork. Cool completely before using. (You may also refrigerate for 2-3 days before using. ). To assemble, press 1-inch balls of dough into the bottom and up the sides of ungreased mini muffin cups. Fill each with 1 rounded teaspoons of chili-mango filling. Bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes until edges are golden brown. Cool in pan on a wire rack; carefully remove tassies from pan when cool.

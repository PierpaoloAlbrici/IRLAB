### Ingredients

 - 3-4 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw

 - 14 cup of lemon juice, raw

 - 12 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Wash your chicken and pat it dry with paper towels. Combine the lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper and stir them together well. If you're using a whole chicken, rub it all over with some of this mixture, making sure to rub plenty inside the body cavity, as well. If you're using cut-up chicken, put it in a large zip-lock bag, pour the marinade over the chicken and seal the bag. Let the chicken marinade for at least an hour, or as long as a day. At least 1 hour before you want to serve the chicken, pull it out of the bag. You can either grill your chicken or you can roast it in a 375 degree oven for about 1 hour. Either way, cook it until the juices run clear when it's pierced to the bone. Recipe from the book "500 Low-carb Recipes" by Dana Carpender.

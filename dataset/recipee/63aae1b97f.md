### Ingredients

 - 6 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 cup of onions, raw

 - 1 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

 - 3 tablespoon of nuts, pine nuts, dried

### Instructions

In a large, heavy saucepan, heat 4 tablespoons of the oil over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring, until the onions just turn golden (do not let them brown), about 5 minutes. Add 4 cups of cold water and salt and bring to a boil. Add the rice, stir and cook, uncovered, until the water is level with the rice, about 10 minutes. Cover the pot, adjust the heat to low and cook until the rice is tender, about 10 minutes longer. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in a small skillet set over medium-high heat. When the oil just begins to bubble, add the pine nuts and cook until the nuts are golden brown. Immediately drain them, discard the oil and set them aside. When the rice is done, scatter the pine nuts over the top. Serve the rice with lahmeh fil mehleh.

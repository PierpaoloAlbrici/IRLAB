### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 34 teaspoon of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

 - 34 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of cheese, cheddar

 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 450. In a large bowl stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cream of tartar. Using a pastry blender, cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in cheese. Make a well in the center of flour mixture. Add milk all at once. Using a fork, stir just until mixture is moistened. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough by folding and gently pressing it just until it holds together. Pat or lightly roll until 3/4-inch thick. Cut with a floured 2 1/2 inch round cutter, dipping cutter into flour between cuts; reroll scraps as necessary. Place dough circles 1 inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 10-14 minutes or until golden. Remove biscuits from baking sheet; serve warm.

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

 - 2 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Place rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold water until the water runs clear. Place rice and measured water in a medium saucepan with a tightfitting lid and bring to a boil over high heat. Add salt (if using), stir to incorporate, cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer undisturbed until rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit covered to steam, about 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork and serve.

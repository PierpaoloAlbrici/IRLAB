## Korean-Style Black Beans

[7649cc7d2e](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/korean-style-black-beans-379709)

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of beans, snap, green, raw

 - 6 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1/2 cup of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

 - 1 tablespoon of honey

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, sesame, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Wash the beans thoroughly, then place them in the slow cooker insert along with the water. Mix together the soy sauce, sugar, and sesame oil and pour over the beans, stirring in thoroughly. Cover and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours, or until the beans are tender. Perhaps something with bubbles, such as Prosecco or a sparkling Californian wine. And if all else fails, a good ol beer would complement this dish nicely (and would be more traditional than wine as an accompaniment).

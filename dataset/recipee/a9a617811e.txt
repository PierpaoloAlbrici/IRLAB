 - 6 ounce of butter, without salt

In a mixer bowl with paddle attachment add flour and salt- mix well on low. Continue on low and add butter and mix on low until the mixture looks coarse and crumbly. Add shortening a little at a time. When the mixture is clumpy and holds together when pressed between your fingers add the water and mix until incorporated into dough. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and fold over a few times. Wrap the dough in plastic and chill for at least 2 hours or up to 5 days in the refrigerator. When chilled roll out and use.

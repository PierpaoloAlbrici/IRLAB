Strawberry Marshmallow Mousse


Ingredients


 - 9 ounce of strawberries, raw


 - 1 ounce of sugars, granulated


 - 5 ounce of candies, marshmallows


 - 78 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


Instructions: 

Put all but 2 of the strawberries into a pan along with 7 tbs water and the sugar. Over a medium heat, cook the strawberries until soft enough to mash, about 3 minutes. Take off the heat and squash the berries, using a fork, until pulpy. Add the marshmallows, then stir them into the hot strawberries until they dissolve. Leave to cool. Whip the cream until it holds it's shape. Fold the cream into the cooled strawberry mix, then spoon into one bowl or separate pots and chill for about 2 hours or until set. Cut the reserved strawberries in half to decorate.

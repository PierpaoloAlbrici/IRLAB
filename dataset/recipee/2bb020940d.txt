 - 1 teaspoon of spices, caraway seed


Instructions: 

Place ingredients except seeds and onion flakes in bread machine according to the instructions of your machine. Mine calls for wet ingredients first so I listed them in order to be placed into the machine. Be sure to place the salt and yeast in separate corners. Set machine on the dough cycle. Place seeds and onion flakes in when machine beeps during the end of kneading. Lightly oil large baking pan. When dough cycle is finished remove dough to a floured work surface. Divide into two. Roll out into a 1 inch disk. Fold one side in to center pressing with rolling pin, then the other half fold to center pressing inches Then fold at center line pressing seams to seal. Roll the loaf forward and back to form a 12 inch loaf. Repeat with the other 1/2 of the dough. Place both on the pan leaving room for them to raise. Cover with oiled plastic wrap. Place in a warm draft free place for 45 minutes. Remove wrap dust with flour and score the loafs Leave to stand for ten minutes while you preheat oven to 425 degrees. Bake for 20 minutes. It will sound hallow when you tap on the bottom which will be dark. Cool on wire rack.

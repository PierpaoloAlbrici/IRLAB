Strawberry Fool (Light)


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of strawberries, raw


 - 3 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 1 pint of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


 - 3 tablespoon of cream, sour, cultured


 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Combine strawberries and granulated sugar in a large bowl. Cover and chill 2 hours. Combine brown sugar, confectioners sugar, vanilla extract and yogurt and sour cream in a blender. Blend for a minute or two so that the sugars are blended in and you have incorporated a bit of air in the dairy mix. (i've also done this with an immersion blender.) Turn out into a covered bowl and chill for 2 hours. Just before serving, gently fold the strawberry mixture into the yogurt mixture until swirled.

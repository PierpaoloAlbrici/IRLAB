### Ingredients

 - 1 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, caraway seed

### Instructions

Place 1/4 cup of the warm water in a large bowl and sprinkle the yeast over it, stirring to dissolve. Add the remaining water, honey, and butter. Slowly stir in the rye flour and 3/4 cup of the all-purpose flour, blending well. Stir in the remaining flour, salt and the caraway seeds, to make a stiff batter. Cover and let rest 20 minutes. Stir down the batter and pour into a greased 9 x 5 loaf pan. Cover and let stand in a warm, draft-free place until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake in a 350 deg oven for 30 to 40 minutes or until done. Turn out and cool on a wire rack. Note: The batter should be stiff - like a kuchen or other cake batter. It should not be so stiff that you could imagine kneading it, nor as thin as pancake batter.

 - 3 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/2 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow

Instructions: 

Heat the oven to 350. Grease a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with a little oil or butter. Whisk together the flours, cornmeal, baking powder, sugar and salt. Add the oil or butter and beer, and stir just until everything is combined. Pour into the loaf pan and bake until the loaf is nicely browned and a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, 45 to 60 minutes. Cool on a rack for 15 minutes before removing from the pan and serving.

### Ingredients

 - 2 tablespoon of mango nectar, canned

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, curry powder

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw

 - 14 cup of spices, coriander seed

### Instructions

Oil grill and preheat bbq to "medium". Mix chutney, oil, curry powder and salt in a large bowl. Crumble in the chicken. Sprinkle with coriander and gently mix together with your hands or a fork. Shape into 4 burgers. Make a depression in the middle of each burger, with your thumb, so they don't "puff up". Place on grill and barbecue with the lid closed until cooked through. This usually takes 5-8 minutes per side. Serve on buns or pitas. Alternately, pan fry over medium heat in an oil-coated, covered skillet 5-6 minutes per side. They should be brown & firm to the touch. (you may have to lower your heat to med-low, if they brown too quickly).

### Ingredients

 - 1 tablespoon of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt

 - 1/3 cup of egg substitute, powder

 - 1/2 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

 - 1 1/4 cup of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry

 - 1/8 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Who just calls it "Noodles and Rice." In a medium-sized saucepan heat the butter or possibly margarine. When bubbly, add in the egg noodles and stir till browned, about 2 min. Add in the rice and cook about 3 more min. Add in the chicken stock/broth and spice and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cover. Cook for 20-30 min till rice is done, stirring occasionally. Allow to sit for a few min before serving. Serves four. "If you ever drop your keys in a river of molten lava, let 'em go because, man, they're gone."

### Ingredients

 - 3 quart of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 12 cup of sugars, brown

 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 cup of syrups, corn, light

 - 5 ounce of nuts, almonds

 - 14 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Place popped popcorn in a large roasting pan that has been sprayed with a non-stick spray and set aside. In saucepan on low heat mix sugars, butter, salt, and corn syrup. Let mixture come to a soft boil and place lid on pan for 30 seconds. Remove lid and stir with clean spoon. This is done so all sugar and salt crystals are dissolved and none get back in the mixture. Turn heat down and let boil gently with out a lid for 5 minutes stirring constantly. When 5 minutes are up remove from heat and stir in baking soda. Syrup will foam but this is normal. Stir until baking soda is completely dissolved. Add butter flavoring and stir. Pour over popcorn slowly stirring popcorn constantly, coating all the popcorn gently. When popcorn is coated, pour almonds in and stir well. Place in a preheated oven at 225 degrees for 1 hour. Popcorn needs to be stirred and mixed through every 15 minutes. When popcorn is finished baking pour onto a non-stick service and let cool.

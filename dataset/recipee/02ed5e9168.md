 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 4 cup of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

Stiff Consistency: In large bowl, cream shortening and butter with electric mixer. Add cocoa and vanilla. Gradually add sugar, one cup at a time, beating well on medium speed. Scrape sides and bottom of bowl often. When all sugar has been mixed in, icing will appear dry. Add milk, 1 tbsp at a time until you get the desired consistency and beat at medium speed until light and fluffy. Keep bowl covered with a damp cloth until ready to use. For best results, keep icing bowl in refrigerator when not in use. Refrigerated in an airtight container, this icing can be stored 2 weeks. Rewhip before using. Chocolate Mocha Icing: Substitute cold brewed strong coffee for milk in Chocolate Buttercream recipe. Darker Chocolate Icing: Add an additional 1/4 cup cocoa (or one additional 1 oz. square unsweetened chocolate, melted) and 1 additional tablespoon milk to Chocolate Buttercream Icing. For Thin (Spreading) Consistency Icing: Add 3-4 tablespoons light corn syrup, water or milk.

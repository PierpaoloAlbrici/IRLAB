Chutney Rice


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 2 1/4 cup of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry


 - 12 cup of mango nectar, canned


 - 12 cup of raisins, seeded


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, curry powder


 - 12 cup of nuts, almonds


Instructions: 

Pour chicken broth into a saucepan and bring to a boil. Slowly add rice to broth (adding too quickly may cause a boil over). Reduce heat and simmer, covered 20 minutes. Remove from heat and add the chutney, raisins and curry powder and stir until well mixed. Let stand approximately 5 minutes for flavors to blend. Sprinkle with the toasted almonds before serving.

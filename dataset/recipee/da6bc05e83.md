[da6bc05e83](http://www.food.com/recipe/mesub-60833)

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 34 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 3 cup of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Put all the ingredients in a wok. Mix well. Switch on the gas. Start rotating the mixture in a clockwise direction with the help of a'tavetha'. Rotate the mixture continuously in the same direction. After 5 minutes, the ghee will start binding the mixture. In another 4-5 minutes, you will see globules of ghee on the edges. Also, you will see the colour of the mixture turn to a light yellow. Keep the flame on medium heat. The mixture will start getting fluffy and bind together. In the meantime,grease a moulding plate with a tsp. or two of ghee. Empty the contents of the wok on to the greased plate. Sprinkle few drops of water on it. Now the Mesub is ready and starts getting crystallised at the surface. Sprinkle cardamom powder (to taste) on it. Cut into diamond shaped pieces. It is now ready to eat. Store in an airtight container and use within one week. I like to store mine refrigerated. Cooking tip: For soft mesub, rotate the mixture in the same direction.

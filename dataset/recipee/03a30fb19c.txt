Piadine Romagnole (Italian Flatbread)


Ingredients


 - 500 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 75 ml of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 100 ml of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 100 ml of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Work all together with food processor. Adjust humidity adding flour or water until dough is not sticky and can be rolled out easily. Lest rest at least 60 minutes. Cut into 8 slices and shape them into balls. Roll out each ball until about 10 inches size. You will not need flour on the table. Put the rolled out piadine on a tray using parchment foil to separate them . Now heat up your skillet or an old non sticking fry pan to medium high. Bake dry on the first side, check the underside, and when it looks done, flip it and bake the other side. The piadina should be pale, but with dark brown spots. Be careful not to burn it. During baking pinch them and roll them with the fork. In about 3-4 minutes they should be ready. In the meanwhile roll out the second piadina. Note: If you use milk it will be softer inside but you can replace it with water this depends on your choice. Note: I work with to pans at the same time. When 4 pieces are ready we eat them. Then I prepare the next ones. I know, this is not chef friendly, but fresh done are much better.

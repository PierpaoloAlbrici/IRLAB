Ingredients


 - 1 1/4 pound of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 2 1/2 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 2 tablespoon of vanilla extract


 - 2 1/4 pound of goji berries, dried


Instructions: 

Combine the chocolate, heavy cream, and the vanilla in a heat-proof bowl and set it over a pan of simmering water until the chocolate melts. About 5 minutes before serving, remove the berries from the freezer and place them on individual serving plates. Ladle the warm chocolate sauce over the berries and serve. Yield: 8 to 10 servings Note: You can either buy frozen berries, or freeze your own by placing the berries on a flat tray in layer. When the berries are fully frozen, keep them a plastic bag in the freezer. Larger berries, such as strawberries, do not freeze well.

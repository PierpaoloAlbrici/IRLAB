### Ingredients

 - 120 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 30 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched

 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

 - 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 100 ml of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 15 g of butter, salted

### Instructions

Make the bread dough and prove once. I make my dough in a bread maker that's fitted with special dough kneading blades, but you can knead by hand if you'd prefer. After the first proving, split the dough into 3, and place them in a cake tin that's been greased with a small amount of oil. I use a cake tin to make it easier to put the dough in the fridge. To stop the dough from drying out, place a well-wrung damp cloth over the top of the tin. Then cover the cloth with some cling film. Then place the tin into the fridge and leave the dough to prove for a second time overnight. I always place the dough in the fridge sometime around 10 or 12 pm. In the morning, take the tin out of the fridge, peel off the damp cloth, and put the tin in the oven. Don't bother with preheating. Simply set your oven to 200C and bake the bread for 17 minutes. It's ready!

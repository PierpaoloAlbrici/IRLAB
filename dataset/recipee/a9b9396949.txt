Creamy Chicken Taco Fettuccine


Ingredients


 - 8 ounce of kashi, steam meal, chicken fettuccine, frozen entree


 - 2 cup of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 3 teaspoon of seasoning mix, dry, taco, original


 - 2 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard


Instructions: 

Cook fettuccine per package directions. While thats cooking, season chicken with garlic salt and seasoned salt and cook chicken and garlic in olive oil in a large skillet until juices run clear and heated through. Whisk in cream and taco seasoning until blended. Cook and stir until heated through. Dont boil because the cream will curdle. Stir in some Parmesan cheese (I used 1 cup on this step). Drain fettuccine and toss it with the chicken sauce. Top with remaining parmesan cheese.

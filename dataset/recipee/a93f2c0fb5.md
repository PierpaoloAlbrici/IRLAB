### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 3 tablespoon of sugars, brown

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 3 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

Mix the dry ingredients (flour through salt) in a medium bowl. Mix in the sunflower oil and vanilla extract. Slowly mix in the water, being careful not to add too much. At this time, mix the dough with your hands so you get a feel for the consistency. Flatten the dough into a round disk. Wrap it in a sheet of plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably longer. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (177 degrees C). Roll out the dough on a silicone baking mat. I place a piece of plastic wrap on top of the dough and roll on top of it with a rolling pin. The dough should be about 1/8 inch thick. Cut into rectangles and poke holes on top with a fork for decoration. Sprinkle with extra demerara sugar if you wish. Place silicon mat on a baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes.

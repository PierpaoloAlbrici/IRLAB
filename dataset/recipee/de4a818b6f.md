### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of apples, raw, with skin

 - 34 cup of oats

 - 34 cup of sugars, brown

 - 34 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 12 cup of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 375F. Slice apples in large greased large casserole dish. You can leave them unpeeled or peeled as you wish. Combine dry ingredients, then cut in margarine until crumbly. Put over fruit and cook for approximately 35 to 45 minutes until fruit is cooked through. Check with a knife - if the fruit is soft and the oatmeal crisp is brown, it is done. You can substitue diced rhubarb, pears, berries like saskatoons or blueberries for part or all of the apples. You may want to sprinkle a bit of cornstarch over top before you put the oatmeal over top to thicken the fruit as it cooks. Apples don't need thickening, but berries and pears are juicier. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.

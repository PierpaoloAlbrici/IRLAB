### Ingredients

 - 4 ounce of butter, without salt

 - 2 ounce of sugars, powdered

 - 10 ounce of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 2 ounce of butter, without salt

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

 - 34 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

 - 1 ounce of spices, ginger, ground

 - 4 tablespoon of sugars, powdered

### Instructions

Cream the 4 ozs butter with the sugar. Combine flour, 1 tsp. ginger, and baking powder; add to the butter mixture. Put into a greased shortbread pan (or a 7-8" round or square baking pan) and bake at 325 F (170 C) for about 40 minutes or until done. While the shortbread is baking, prepare the icing: melt together the butter, ginger, and golden syrup in a saucepan over low heat until blended and smooth. Pour the icing over the hot shortbread and let it cool a little. When the icing has cooled a bit, decorate the top with pieces of candied ginger. Cut shortbread into shapes (wedges or rectangles). Cool completely before removing from pan. *Note:You may leave out the candied ginger- some may find it too spicy, especially children.

### Ingredients

 - 2 1/4 cup of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw

 - 1 cup of celery, raw

 - 1 cup of grapes, red or green (european type, such as thompson seedless), raw

 - 12 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 2 tablespoon of parsley, fresh

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular

Combine all ingredients. Chill and Serve. (Prep time includes poaching chicken. Although this says approximately 4 chicken breasts I personally find that to be more than 2 1/4 cups of diced chicken).

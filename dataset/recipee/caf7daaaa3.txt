Crusting Cream Cheese Icing/Frosting


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 12 cup of shortening, vegetable, household, composite


 - 1 pound of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract


 - 3 1/2 pound of sugars, granulated


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Cream butter, shortening, cream cheese and extracts. Gradually add confectioner's sugar and salt. Beat on low speed until nice and creamy. If you want whiter icing, try to use butter without dyes available at most health food stores. This recipe is for a stiff consistency. For a thinner consistency, use 3 pounds of powdered sugar instead. If you want a very smooth cake, let the cake sit for 15 minutes after icing (longer for a thinner icing). Then using your spatula or fondant smoothing tool (this works best) smooth it with the non-printed side of a Viva paper towel. To do this, take your paper towel and lay it on your icing (after it crusts) and lightly rub over the paper towel with your spatual or fondant smoothing tool to get a smooth surface. If the icing sticks to the paper towel, you didn't let it "crust" long enough. Stick it in the fridge for 20 minutes or so to let it "crust" then try again. Don't let it set too much tho then it will be difficult to smooth it. This recipe will ice, fill and decorate an 8" double layer cake with icing left over.

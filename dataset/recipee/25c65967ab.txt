Instructions: 

Sift dry ingredients together. Cut 3 tablespoons butter into dry ingredients and add milk slowly, mixing to make a smooth dough. Roll about 1/4 inch thick on a floured board and spread with apples, raisins, sugar and cinnamon which have been mixed together. Roll like a jelly roll and cut across in 2" slices. Place the slices in a well greased baking pan, cut side down, sprinkle well with the maple sugar, dot with remaining butter and add water. Bake at 400F about 30 minutes, basting often with the sauce in the pan. Serve with a sauce made from cream, a little maple sugar and a dash of grated nutmeg.

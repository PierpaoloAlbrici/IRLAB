Butterscotch Walnut Bars Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 3/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1/4 cup of syrups, corn, light


 - 6 ounce of salt, table


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 8 ounce of nuts, walnuts, english


Instructions: 

CRUST: In bowl mix flour, salt and sugar. With pastry blender cut in butter till mix resembles coarse meal. Spread mix proportionately in greased 13 x 9x 2 inch pan, then with hand press firmly into smooth compact layer. Bake in preheated 375 degree oven about 12 min or possibly till lightly browned. Remove pan to rack while you prepare topping. TOPPING: Combine syrup, butterscotch pcs, salt, butter and water in large heavy saucepan. With rubber spatula stir over low heat, pressing butterscotch till melted and smooth. (A few tiny unmelted pcs of butterscotch are all right.) Quickly stir in walnuts and remove from heat. Working quickly to prevent mix from hardening, place large spoonfuls on hot baked crust. With back of spoon spread mix to within 1/2 to 3/4 inch of crust edges (during baking, topping will run toward edges). Bake in 375 degree oven 10 min. Cold in pan 30 to 40 min or possibly till only slightly hot. With small sharp knife loosen around edges, then cut in 16 bars. (Bars in center of pan will appear too soft, but they will become hard as they cold; wait to remove them.) With wide metal spatula transfer bars to cutting board; cold thoroughly till hard. Cut each bar in half.

### Ingredients

 - 1 quart of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 12 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 2-3 tablespoon of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat

 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

### Instructions

In a saucepan - bring your milk, dry milk and sugar to just below boiling (aprox 180 degrees) Don't let it actually come to a boil. Turn off heat and let cool to luke warm. Meanwhile put your yogurt in a small bowl and let come to room temperature. When your jars are sterilized quickly place the empty jars into the cooler and close the lid. This will keep the jars warm and warm up the incubator. When the milk has cooled down remove 1/2 cup and whisk it into the yogurt. Return the mixture to the pan. Add the vanilla and stir to distribute. Take your jars out of the cooler and replace the lid. Transfer yogurt to jars and put their lids/caps on. Place them into the cooler and wind a kitchen towel around the jars to hold more warmth. Replace the lid and forget about the yogurt for 5 hours. If after 5 hours your yogurt still seems a little runny just let them sit another hour. During that time don't fiddle with the cooler. It seems long winded, but it really is simple.

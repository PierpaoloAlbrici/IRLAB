Strawberry Bread


Ingredients


 - 50 g of strawberries, raw


 - 150 g of strawberries, raw


 - 200 g of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 20 g of sugars, granulated


 - 5 g of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 2 1/2 g of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 3 g of salt, table


 - 15 g of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Preparation: Cut the dried strawberries into about 5 mm pieces. Place into a sieve, and pour hot water. Blot dry with a paper towel. Wash and drain the strawberries, place into a mixer, and puree. After that, we will be working with 145 g. Add the ingredients from step 2 and salt to the bread maker, and set the dried strawberries into the ingredients section. Start the dough course. Add in the butter after 5 minutes. Take out the finished dough, punch it to thoroughly release the gas. Roll up into 5 equal portions, and let rise for 15 minutes. Punch lightly again, and roll back up. Press down on the center of the dough with a cooking chopstick rubbed with flour. Sheet a pan with parchment paper, and proof for the second time until doubled in size. Timing by the size, preheat the oven to 200C. After the second proofing, if the mark left by chopstick has disappeared, then press down on it again. Place the flour into a tea strainer, and sprinkle onto the dough. Lower the temperature of the oven to 150C, and bake for 15 minutes. Cool on a rack, and they're done. 'Strawberry Cream Bread' uses the same dough.

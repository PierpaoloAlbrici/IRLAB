Raw Vegan Brownies


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of nuts, walnuts, english


 - 1 cup of dates, deglet noor


 - 14 cup of chocolate, dark, 70-85% cacao solids


 - 12 tablespoon of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


Instructions: 

Put all ingredients into food processor. Process just enough to mix everything, maybe 30 seconds, just so that when you pinch some of the mixture it sticks together. If you prefer a more chewy type of brownie, the more you process it, the more chewy and less cake-like it will be. It can get quite fudgy if you process it longer. We prefer it processed less, and more cake-like. Try it different ways and discover what you like best! Press mixture into pan, and refrigerate for a couple of hours. Cut into squares and store in airtight container in fridge or freezer. Note: We have eaten this many times right from the food processor. It will sometimes be a little crumbly this way, which is why the refridgeration is recommended to set the mixture. Optional: You can also use raw carob powder instead of the raw cacao powder, or you can use 1/8 cup of each.

[c92cc01709](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/gelato-alla-fragola-strawberry-gelato-recipe.html)

### Ingredients

 - 12 ounce of strawberries, raw

 - 3/4 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1/2 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw

### Instructions

In a blender combine the strawberries, sugar and whole milk and puree until smooth. Add in the heavy cream and mix just enough to combine (you do not want to whip the cream). Add in the lemon juice. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Refrigerating overnight is best because it will allow the flavor to intensify. Transfer the mixture into an ice cream machine and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serve at once with fresh cut strawberries, if desired, or freeze for up to one month. You can substitute the following fruits using the above recipe: Bananas, peaches, Pears, raspberries, blackberries, apricots, Granny Smith apples and blueberries.

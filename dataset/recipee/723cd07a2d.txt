Vegan Oat & Flax Crisps with Coconut


Ingredients


 - 23 cup of oats


 - 13 cup of seeds, flaxseed


 - 1/2 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


 - 2 tablespoon of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 tablespoon of seeds, chia seeds, dried


 - 3 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/4 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


 - 13 cup of beverages, almond milk, unsweetened, shelf stable


 - 3 tablespoon of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats. Set aside. In a large bowl, mix all the dry ingredients (oats through salt) together. In a small bowl, mix all the wet ingredients (coconut oil through vanilla) together. Pour the wet ingredients into the large bowl gradually. Stir all the ingredients together. Drop tablespoon-sized scoops of the dough onto the cookie sheet, leaving about 2 inches between each. I used a measuring spoon for this step. Flatten each scoop of dough using your hand, so that each cookie is thin. Bake the cookies for about 18-25 minutes. Start checking the cookies at about the 15 minute mark (or a few minutes before that) to see if they have browned. If the cookies are quite brown around the edges, remove them from the oven. I wanted my cookies to be more crisp and brown, so I left them in there for about 22 minutes. Remove from oven and allow cookies to cool. Enjoy the cookies when cooled!

### Ingredients

 - 1 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 12 cup of cheese, ricotta, whole milk

 - 18 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Place and 8 inch crepe or omelette pan over medium heat for 2 minutes. Add olive oil, wait about 10 seconds and swirl to coat the pan. Then wait about 30 seconds longer to let the oiled pan get really hot. Spoon the cheese into the pan, distributing it as evenly as possible. (Be sure not to get splattered, especially when useing low fat cheese.) Let it cook without stirring for about 5 minutes. Move the cheese aroung the pan a little, turning the cheese over and rearranging it to maximize contact with the heat. Sprinkle in a little salt, then let the cheese cook about 5 minutes longer. Rearrange the cheese again. This time it will suddenly come together in a soft mass. Transfer it to a plate, and serve right away. Pass the pepper mill.

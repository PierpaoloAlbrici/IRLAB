### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2/3 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

In a large bowl, stir together flour, salt and water until a soft dough is formed. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly. Divide dough into golf ball size pieces and cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap. Select a ball of dough and roll out until very thin but not torn. Sprinkle lightly and evenly with sugar. Fold up dough into a small square and roll out again until thin. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Place the rolled dough onto the pan and cook for 1/2 to 1 minute on each side until golden. Serve immediately. Repeat until all dough balls have been rolled and cooked.

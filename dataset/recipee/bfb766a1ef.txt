Ginger Scented Pecans


Ingredients


 - 5 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


 - 2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 teaspoon of oil, canola


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 325. Place nuts in a single layer on two rimmed baking sheets. Toast until nuts are fragrant, 10 to 15 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through cooking. Meanwhile, combine sugar, salt, and ginger in a small bowl, and set aside. Combine honey, 2 tablespoons water, and oil in a large saucepan, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, and add roasted pecans. Cook, stirring once or twice, until all of the liquid has evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, add sugar mixture, and toss until well combined. Spread nuts in a single layer on a sheet of parchment paper (or wax paper) to cool. These pecans may be kept in an airtight container at room temperature for 1 week.

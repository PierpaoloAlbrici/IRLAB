### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, canola

 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of molasses

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 1/2-2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 tablespoon of seeds, sunflower seed kernels, dried

 - 1 1/2-2 tablespoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, caraway seed

### Instructions

Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let sit until frothy ~10 minutes. Add oil, molasses, and whole wheat flour and mix until full incorporated. Slowly add all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup at a time, and salt. I usually use about 1.75 cups of the AP flour. Add in seeds. Knead in a mixer about 10 minutes, or longer if youre kneading by hand. Place into a greased bowl and let rise until double, about 1.5 hours. Deflate the dough and let rise again until double, about 50 minutes. Deflate dough and flatten with a rolling pin into a long rectangle, about 8 inches wide. Slowly roll the dough into an 8&#8243; wide log, squeezing out all the excess air as you go. Pinch seams together and place seam side down into a 8x4" loaf pan. Let rise about 30 minutes in loaf pan and preheat oven to 350. Bake about 35-40 minutes.

Strawberries with Ricotta Cream and Pistachios


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of cheese, ricotta, whole milk


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 2 tablespoon of orange juice, raw


 - 1 pint of strawberries, raw


 - 1/4 cup of nuts, pistachio nuts, raw


Instructions: 

Place the ricotta in a small strainer set over a bowl and refrigerate for 30 minutes to drain the excess liquid. Transfer the drained ricotta to a food processor or blender, add the brown sugar and orange liqueur, and process until smooth. (The ricotta mixture can be made up to 8 hours in advance, covered and kept refrigerated.) Divide the strawberries among 4 dessert bowls and top each with a 1/4 cup of the ricotta mixture and sprinkle with the pistachios.

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of soymilk, original and vanilla, unfortified

 - 2 tablespoon of vinegar, distilled

 - 6 cup of beans, snap, green, raw

 - 2 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow

 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 400F. Combine the soymilk and vinegar and let stand 5 minutes or more. Heat the beans until very hot, then pour into a 9- x 12-inch baking dish. Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl, and add the soymilk mixture and oil. Stir just to mix, then pour over the hot beans, and bake until the bread is set and golden brown, about 30 minutes.

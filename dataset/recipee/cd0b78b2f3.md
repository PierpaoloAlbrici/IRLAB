[cd0b78b2f3](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/appetizers-and-snacks/peanutty-apple-dip/)

### Ingredients

 - 6 ounce of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat

 - 1 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

 - 1/4 cup of honey

### Instructions

Blend yogurt and peanut butter together until incorporated. Stir in honey; refrigerate until serving time. Excellent alongside crisp apples. NOTES: If desired, use smooth peanut butter and add chopped, roasted peanut for crunch. We love crunchy peanut butter around our house and it makes this dip all the more quick to put together. Also, I use whatever single-serve container of yogurt I have on hand; for some brands, its 6 oz. and others, its 8.

### Ingredients

 - 2/3 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 1/2 cup of syrups, corn, light

 - 1/3 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 8 ounce of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022

 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt

### Instructions

In a 4-quart saucepan over moderate heat, bring the cream, corn syrup, sugar, salt and chocolate to a boil, stirring constantly. Simmer until mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the butter. Serve while still warm. What Makes This Recipe Sing: The versatility of this sauce makes it the WOW hostess gift. Try with grilled fruit, over sponge cakes or even as a "no need for the fondue pot" chocolate dunk for fresh fruits, cookies and pound cakes. This sauce is a classic and of course perfect for your favorite ice cream... My choice is peppermint ice cream. Also, it makes for easily made s'mores and if all else fails, just use a good old-fashioned spoon! BYOC: Try adding a swirl, by heating peanut butter and swirling in the fudge. Add your favorite toasted nuts, a drop of peppermint or orange oil, or even your favorite cereal for a crunchy fudge sauce.

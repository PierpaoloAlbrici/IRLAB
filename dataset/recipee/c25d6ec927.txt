Perfect Lemonade Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 cup of lemon juice, raw


 - 3-4 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Make simple syrup by heating the sugar and water in a small saucepan until the sugar is dissolved completely. While the sugar is dissolving, use a juicer to extract the juice from 4 to 6 lemons, enough for one cup of juice. Add the juice and the sugar water to a pitcher. Add 3 to 4 cups of cold water, more or less to the desired strength. Refrigerate 30 to 40 minutes. If the lemonade is a little sweet for your taste, add a little more straight lemon juice to it. Serve with ice, sliced lemons.

### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 1/2 cup of syrups, corn, light

 - 1 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

 - 4 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt

 - 1 cup of oats

 - 1 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 1 cup of cranberries, dried, sweetened

### Instructions

Line a 9" x 13" baking dish with foil and coat the foil with nonstick cooking spray. (I just use parchment paper, ungreased). In a large saucepan, combine the sugar, corn syrup, and peanut butter over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add the remaining ingredients; mix well then spread evenly into the prepared pan. Let cool then cut into bars and serve, or cover until ready to serve.

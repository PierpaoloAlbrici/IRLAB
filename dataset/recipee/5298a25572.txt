Whipped Cream


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 1 to 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

With an electric mixer, or by hand with a whisk and stainless steel bowl, whip the cream until it begins to mound and hold its shape. Whisk in 1 tablespoon sugar and the vanilla. Taste, then add the additional tablespoon of sugar if you wish. Whip until the cream forms soft, droopy peaks. If you whip the cream in advance and store it in the refrigerator, it may separate as it sits. A light whisking will bring it back.

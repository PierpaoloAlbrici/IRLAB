### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 12 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1 1/2 cup of oats

 - 14 cup of syrups, corn, light

 - 12 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 719283140692

 - 12 cup of nuts, walnuts, english

 - 23 cup of candies, marshmallows

### Instructions

Place butter in an 8-inch square, microwave-safe baking dish. Microwave until the butter is melted. Stir in the brown sugar until dissolved. Add the rest of the ingredients one at a time and stir well. If your corn syrup hardens just microwave it until it is liquid again. Press the mixture firmly into the dish or shape them into balls and put them on a plate. Microwave for three to five minutes or until lightly browned. If your microwave does not have a rotating carousel, rotate the dish twice during cooking. Let the cookies cool and then cut them into bars with a sturdy knife unless you chose to make them into balls.

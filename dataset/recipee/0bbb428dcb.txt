Honey-Mustard Green Beans


Ingredients


 - 4 teaspoon of honey


 - 4 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 4 teaspoon of vinegar, cider


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 34 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 pound of beans, snap, green, raw


Instructions: 

In a large bowl, whisk together honey, mustard, vinegar, olive oil and salt; set aside. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add green beans and cook until just tender, about 5 minutes. (You could steam them instead if desired.) Drain well and pat dry with paper towels. Toss green beans in honey-mustard mixture and serve warm or at room temperature.

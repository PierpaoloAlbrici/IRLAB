Spicy Peanut Butter Popcorn


Ingredients


 - 13 cup of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)


 - 3 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 cup of honey


 - 13 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 1 teaspoon of sauce, hot chile, sriracha


Instructions: 

Place oil and kernels in a large pot and cover with a lid. Place over high heat and cook until you hear all kernels are popped. Pour into a large bowl and sprinkle with salt. In a small saucepan, heat up honey and sugar. Let boil for 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in peanut butter and Sriracha sauce. Its not an easy task, but trust me, it works out in the end. Pour sauce over the popcorn and stir gently so as not to break up all your puffy corn. Spread onto a cookie sheet in an even layer to cool. This makes it firm up better and seems to keep the corn from getting too soggy. Once cool, serve in a bowl.

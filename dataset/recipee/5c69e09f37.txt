Hg's Fiber-Ific Fried Chicken Strips - Ww Points = 5


Ingredients


 - 6 ounce of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw


 - 12 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt


 - 14 cup of egg substitute, powder


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 18 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Using a blender or food processor, grind the cereal to a breadcrumb-like consistency. Add garlic salt and black pepper to crumbs. Place crumbs in one small dish and egg substitute in another. Next, coat raw chicken - first with egg and then with crumbs. Place strips on a baking pan sprayed with nonstick spray. Add a light mist of nonstick spray on top and place in the oven. Cook for 10 minutes and then turn strips over. Spritz with another light mist of nonstick spray and cook for an additional 7 to 10 minutes, until chicken is fully cooked and crumb coating looks crispy. Enjoy!

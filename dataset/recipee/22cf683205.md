### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of vinegar, red wine

 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 cup of blueberries, raw

 - 14 cup of pomegranate juice, bottled

### Instructions

Put vinegar and sugar into medium sized sauce pan, bring to a boil, lower to a simmer, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. While vinegar mixture is simmering, wash blueberries, and dry off with paper toweling; put berries between 2 layers of wax paper; gently crush berries until they pop-to get more of the flavor into the vinegar. Use the wax paper to funnel the berries into the quart jar. Remove vinegar mixture from heat, add pomegranate juice to vinegar, put funnel into quart jar, and pour hot vinegar mixture over blueberries. Allow to cool down for 30 minutes. Cover tightly with lid and let stand at room temperature for 3 days. Shake jar occasionally. Place several layers of cheesecloth in a strainer set inside a glass bowl; dump mixture through to strain out the blueberries; discard the blueberries. You might need to repeat this step. While doing the above step, clean a pint jar and lid to put the vinegar into. Using a funnel pour the liquid into the jar, label, cover, and store in refrigerator up to 1 month. (Guessing on storage, but will err on side of caution until someone with the expertise tells me differently).

3 Ingredient Protein Pudding


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of cheese, cottage, creamed, large or small curd


 - 2 tablespoon of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 1 teaspoon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Put this into a blender or Magic Bullet and blend until smooth. It makes it creamy like a pudding and really curbs my sweet tooth. I've been having this almost every evening for dessert. Try pineapple, raspberry, French vanilla and English toffee syrup.

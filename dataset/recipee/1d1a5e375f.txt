Honey Graham Crackers with Cinnamon Sugar


Ingredients


 - 1/4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 13 cup of honey


 - 2 tablespoon of vanilla extract


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 10 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


Instructions: 

In a small bowl, combine the milk, honey and vanilla (extract or paste). In the bowl of a food processor, combine all of the dry ingredients (flour, brown sugar, baking soda and salt). Pulse to combine them. Add the cold butter to the dry ingredients, pulsing to create a coarse crumb. While the food processor is running, slowly pour the wet ingredients into the dough. Process until the dough is just past the crumbly pie crust stage, and has come together into a uniform dough. Turn the dough out onto a sheet of parchment. With a little flour and the sides of the parchment paper, work the dough into a disc, and chill for about 15 minutes. When the dough is chilled, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Shape and roll out the dough into a large rectangle that is about 1/8 thick. Cut the crackers into whatever size squares or rectangles that you desire. Gently move the dough to a silpat or parchment-lined sheet pan. Poke holes in the cracker to prevent them from puffing up. Sprinkle them generously with cinnamon sugar topping. Bake at 325F for 12-15 minutes. Let them cool (they will crisp up more as they cool). They can be stored up to a week in an airtight container.

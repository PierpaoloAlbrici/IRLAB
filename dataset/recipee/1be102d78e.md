### Ingredients

 - 2 ounce of sugars, brown

 - 7 ounce of sugars, granulated

 - 2 ounce of butter, without salt

 - 7 ounce of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

 - 16 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

### Instructions

Place all the ingredients for the base in the bowl of a food processor. Blend the mixture until the mixture takes on a sandy texture. Place 12 cupcake liners into a muffin tin. Using a medium ice cream or cookie scoop place 1 scoop of the base mixture into each cupcake liner. Press the mixture down to form an even layer at the bottom of each mini cupcake liner. Melt the chocolate over a double-boiler. Using your scoop, top each peanut butter filled cupcake liner with 1 scoop of chocolate. Smooth the tops of the Peanut Butter Cups with the back of a spoon. Refrigerate for 1 hour or overnight. Note: To make this quicker, melt the white chocolate in the microwave. Microwave on 30% power for 2 minutes, remove and stir. Continue microwaving on 30 second intervals, stirring after each interval, until chips are melted and mixture is smooth. Do not overheat or the white chocolate will stiffen.

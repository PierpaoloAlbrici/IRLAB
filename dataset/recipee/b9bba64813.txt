Warm Peanut Butter Sauce (For Ice Cream)


Ingredients


 - 4 tablespoon of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


 - 2 tablespoon of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Mix peanut butter and honey in a microwave safe container (I used a small glass measuring cup). Microwave on 50% power for 30 seconds. Stir until completely mixed, microwaving for another 15 seconds if not warm enough. Add milk and stir (it probably won't all come together at this point). Microwave again for 15-30 seconds on 50% power. Stir until smooth. Pour over your favorite ice cream, cookies, muffins -- whatever! :). Enjoy!

[ec15116619](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/145583-tofu-scones-made-with-pancake-mix)

### Ingredients

 - 100 g of pancakes, plain, dry mix, complete (includes buttermilk)

 - 50 g of tofu, raw, regular, prepared with calcium sulfate

### Instructions

Add the pancake mix into a bowl, and crumble in the tofu using your hand. Knead them, and bring the mixture together into a ball. Divide the dough into 4 portions, roll into balls, and flatten. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes at 180C. You can eat as is and still taste the sweetness, but jam goes well with them. I like putting vanilla ice cream in the middle.

Maple Pecan Caramels


Ingredients


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 1/2 cup of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 2 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1/2 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of nuts, pecans


Instructions: 

Line an 8-inch-square baking pan with aluminum foil that extends over the sides. With a paper towel, coat the bottom and sides of the foil with 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil. Set aside. In a 3-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the maple syrup, brown sugar, and cream, and bring to a boil, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon or heat-proof spatula. Wash down the sides of the pan two times with a pastry brush dipped in warm water to prevent the sugar from crystallizing. Place a candy thermometer in the pan and cook the mixture until it registers 242F on the thermometer (10 to 15 minutes), stirring constantly. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the butter, then blend in the pecans. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan. Let the caramel cool completely at room temperature (2 to 3 hours). With the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil, coat a cutting board and the blade of a large chefs knife. Remove the candy from the pan by lifting out the foil; invert the caramel onto the cutting board and peel the foil off the caramel. Cut the caramel evenly into 1-inch squares. In a tightly covered container, between sheets of waxed paper, or wrapped in waxed paper squares, the caramels will keep for 2 weeks at room temperature. Substitute walnuts, Brazil nuts, or almonds for the pecans.

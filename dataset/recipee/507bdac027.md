[507bdac027](http://www.food.com/recipe/southern-cathead-biscuits-417529)

### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1/4-1/3 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 450F Measure 1 cup of buttermilk into liquid measuring cup. I use 3/4 cup whole milk with a splash of Heinz White Vinegar. Let sit a few minutes until you need it. In a medium bowl, measure the flour by spooning it into a one-cup measure and leveling off with a knife. (This is very important!) Sometimes I sift it. Most of the time I do not. Make a deep well and add the oil and buttermilk. Stir gently until moistened. Sprinkle with even flour to allow handling of the dough. I shape my biscuits by hand but you could also roll them out and cut them. Place them in a 9x9 Pampered Chef Baker (stoneware.) I have used Pampered Chef stoneware for the last ten years and it has never failed me. However, for those of you still using metal bakeware, just use a regular square baking pan.

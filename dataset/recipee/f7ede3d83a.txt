KFC Flavor Baked Chicken


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, paprika


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 12 tablespoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 12 tablespoon of spices, thyme, dried


 - 12 tablespoon of spices, basil, dried


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, oregano, dried


 - 12 tablespoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 12 tablespoon of spices, nutmeg, ground


 - 1 cup of mustard, prepared, yellow


Instructions: 

Use 2 to 3 pounds of cut up chicken - skin on. Legs and thighs work best and breasts are OK. The above mix makes a lot! Start with a tablespoon or 2 and increase to coat the chicken. Toss in a gallon bag to cover. Make sure that the chicken is moist but NOT WET. Frozen chicken tends to be wet. Dry it with paper towels before shaking it. So what is the extra secret? Hand rub the chicken pieces with cheap yellow mustard before shaking them in the above mix. The mustard does not add a mustard taste. 20 minutes per pound at 375 degrees or just at high for a Nu-Wave.

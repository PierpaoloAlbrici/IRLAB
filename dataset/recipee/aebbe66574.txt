Kataifi Nests


Ingredients


 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 4 ounce of phyllo dough


 - 4 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Brush 12 muffin cups with butter or use silicone muffin pans. Pull the kataifi into 1-inch-thick bundles; cut bundles into 2-inch lengths. Place in a bowl; separate into a loose pile with fingers. Toss with butter, sugar, and cinnamon, if using. Divide among 12 muffin cups; press into bottom and up the sides. Cook until golden and crisp around the edges, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool. Fill with jelly beans, speckled eggs or other candy eggs.

Orange Glaze


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of orange juice, raw


 - 1/2 cup of orange juice, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of orange juice, raw


 - 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 3 cup of sugars, powdered


Instructions: 

Combine all the ingredients and beat until combined and smooth; it should be about the consistency of thick maple syrup -- just pourable. Adjust the consistency by adding a little more liquid or a little more sugar. Use immediately or store, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

### Ingredients

 - 200 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched

 - 10 g of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 90 ml of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 20 g of sugars, granulated

 - 20 ml of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 dash of salt, table

### Instructions

Sift together the (A) ingredients. Heat up the milk for 30 seconds in the microwave. Combine all of the (B) ingredients except for the milk well. Then add the milk in bit by bit while mixing. Add the sifted ingredients from Step 1 to Step 3 and knead everything together with your hands. Once the dough no longer sticks to your hands, cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest for 20-30 minutes. Divide the dough into 8 portions and form each one into a ball. Then roll each one out with the palm of your hands or a rolling pin. Form it into a wide circle. Add your desired fillings, put the buns in a steamer, and steam them until they're done!

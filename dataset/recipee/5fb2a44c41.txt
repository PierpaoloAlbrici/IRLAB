Elder Lehman's Awesome Barbecue Sauce


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 12 cup of catsup


 - 14 cup of vinegar, cider


 - 2 tablespoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


Instructions: 

Combine all the ingredients in a bowl. Whisk to combine--it may look like it won't come together, but trust me and keep stirring. It will eventually all come together. Once you can't see any of the individual ingredients (i.e. mustard), the sauce is ready to use. ** Do not use an electric mixer/KitchenAid/blender/etc. They mix the sauce too fast and causes it to thicken too much. Mixing by hand takes longer, but is definitely worth it.

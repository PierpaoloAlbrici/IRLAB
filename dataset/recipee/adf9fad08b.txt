Crusty Cranberry Bread With Caramel Almonds (Almost No Knead)


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 12 cup of sugars, brown


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 2 tablespoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 3 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 6 1/2 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 3 tablespoon of vanilla extract


 - 12 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1 1/3 cup of cranberries, dried, sweetened


 - 5 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 12 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 13 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

For the caramel almonds: In a nonstick saucepan heat the ingredients for the caramel almonds over med. high heat for about 8 min until thick and bubbly. Spread out on a non stick pan, and cool in the fridge. Once cool seperate into little pieces and leave at room temperature. For the dough: In a VERY large bowl add the yeast, then the water, flour, brown sugar, and vanilla extract. Mix well until all the flour has been incorporated. Cover bowl with plastic wrap (sprayed with butter spray). Set in a warm area to rise for 2 hours (I turn my oven to warm for 3 minutes, turn it off, and then put my dough to rise in there. Just make sure it's not too hot. ). When the dough has risen, you may at this point put it in the fridge to use at a latter time or use now. When ready to use, cut away about 1/4 of the dough from the rest, and gently mix in a 1/4 of the cranberries and caramelized almonds, until well incorporated. Form into a ball by tucking the edges of dough under until it forms a tight ball. Place on a non stick pan (I like to use the non stick foil) and let it rise in a warm area for another 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees, with a shallow metal pan on the bottom rack. Mix together the topping ingredients. Once the dough has risen, top off with 1/4 of the topping and place on the middle rack. Before closing the door, toss the 1 cup of hot water into the metal pan, closing the door quickly to trap the steam. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes.

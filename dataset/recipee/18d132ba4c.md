[18d132ba4c](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/sidedishes/e2809cune2809d-refried-black-beans/)

### Ingredients

 - 14 ounce of beans, snap, green, raw

 - 1 cup of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry

 - 1/4 cup of onions, raw

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cumin seed

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, chili powder

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Put all the ingredients in a pot on the stove and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and put a lid on the pot about half-cocked so that steam can escape. Simmer for 20 minutes. Remove beans with a slotted spoon, reserving the liquid. At this point you can do one of several things: you can mash beans with a potato masher adding back liquid until they are the desired consistency or (and this is what I do) put the beans in your food processor and pulse, adding liquid until they are the desired consistency. This can be eaten as a side dish, or you can put them on tostadas with pulled pork, in burritos or pretty much whatever your heart desires. My husband was a die hard refried bean (pintos) until he tried these! Now hes a black bean convert!

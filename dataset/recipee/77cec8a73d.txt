Roasted Beets with Roquefort and Pecans


Ingredients


 - 2 pound of beets, raw


 - 1/2 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 3 tablespoon of spices, rosemary, dried


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, oregano, dried


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 1 pinch of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 1/2 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 6 ounce of cheese, roquefort


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 375 F. Wash the beets very well then dry them. Chop the golden beets (do them first to avoid staining them from the purple beets) into large chunks. Transfer to a bowl. Chop the purple beets and transfer to another bowl. Place 1/4 cup of olive oil into each bowl and add half of the rosemary and oregano to each bowl of beets. Season both bowls with salt and pepper. Toss until well combined. Lay the purple beets on one baking tray and the golden on another tray. Place the trays in the oven and bake for 45 minutes or until they can be poked with a sharp knife with little resistance. After 20 minutes give each tray a shuffle with a spatula to make sure the beets are cooking evenly. In the meantime, add the pecans and brown sugar to a saucepan over medium heat and heat until the sugar softens and clings to the pecans, about 10 minutes. Then remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool. Once the beets are done let them cool until you can pick them up and peel of the skin side of each chunk. Transfer each color to a bowl as you peel them. Lay some of each color beet on a plate and top with some of the crumbled cheese and chopped pecans. Garnish with more chopped rosemary and sea salt.

### Ingredients

 - 6 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 14 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

### Instructions

Roll or grind the breakfast cereal. There should be 1 1/2 cups after crushing. Combine with the melted butter, sugar (if using), and cinnamon. An easy way to form the crust is after mixing to press another pie pan of the same diameter firmly into the dough. When the top pan is removed a crust of even thickness is underneath. Trim any excess that is forced to the top edge. Crumb crusts need not be baked before filling, but if used unbaked, must be first chilled thoroughly or the filling will immediately disintegrate the crust. If baked before filling, they require a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes. It is best to cool the empty baked shell before filling. Fill a prebaked shell with chiffon fillings, bavarian creams, or gelatin whips topped with sweetened whipped cream, or with custard or fruit filling, which may be covered with a high meringue.

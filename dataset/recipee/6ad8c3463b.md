### Ingredients

 - 12 ounce of beverages, carbonated, root beer

 - 4 scoop of ice creams, vanilla

### Instructions

In a large bowl, add root beer and place into the freezer for about 1015 minutes until very cold (but not frozen). This will minimize the melting of the ice cream once added in. Remove root beer from the freezer and add half of the ice cream. Gently stir to break up ice cream into small chunks. Add 1 tablespoon ice cream (from the remaining ice cream) into each popsicle mold. Pour root beer mixture almost to the top (about 3/4 full). Place another tablespoon ice cream on the tops of each mold. Insert the popsicle sticks and freeze for at least 2 hours. Enjoy!

Breakfast Tortillas


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 14 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 14 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Put flour, salt, and baking powder into a mixing bowl. Mix the shortening or oil into the flour mixture until it forms pea-size balls. Add the lukewarm water, a little at a time, until the dough is soft and pliable. On a floured surface, knead the dough until smooth, for 1 to 2 minutes. Place in a bowl, cover with a clean dish towel, and let it"rest" for 30 minutes. Knead dough and form 8 to 10 balls. Roll them out as thin and round as possible. Preheat an ungreased griddle or cast-iron frying pan. Heat about 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a frying pan and cook the raw tortilla on both sides until puffy and light golden brown, about 45 seconds altogether. Drain on a paper towel. While tortilla is hot, sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon. Cut in quarters to make it easier for kids to hold.

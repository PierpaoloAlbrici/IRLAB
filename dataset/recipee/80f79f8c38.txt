Peanut Butter Cookie Truffles


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 dash of salt, table


 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

In a bowl, add peanut butter, flour and salt; mix until well combined. Place in the freezer for about 30 minutes. The dough will be soft. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside. Roll peanut butter dough into 1-tablespoon-sized balls. (Because the dough is still soft, they will not form into perfect balls.) Place on prepared baking sheet. Place the baking sheet in the freezer for about 1 hour (I left mine overnight). In a microwave safe bowl, add chocolate wafers and cook for 30 seconds. Mix and cook for another 30 seconds until chocolate is melted. Be sure to mix the chocolate in between each interval. Be careful not to burn your chocolate. With 2 forks, dip the peanut butter balls into the chocolate. Let excess chocolate drip back into bowl; place truffles back onto baking sheet to cool. I store my truffles in the refrigerator.

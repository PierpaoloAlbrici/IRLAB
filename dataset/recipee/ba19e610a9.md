### Instructions

In 6-8 quart stock pan, measure out 2 cups of apple cider. This will be approximately how much you will end up with when finished. Pour in the remaining apple cider. * If it is kept on an unrefrigerated store shelf, DO NOT use it. Place on stove top on medium heat and bring to a low boil . Cook over medium approximately 2-1/2 hours (yes, it does take this long). Stir occasionally (say every 30-45 minutes). As the cider begins to get close to desired level of reduction, the bubbles will get smaller & the boil will look somewhat foamy. Youll need to reduce the heat slightly at this point so that it doesnt boil up or scorch. Remove from stove and let cool. Cider should be thick - almost like corn syrup or molasses when done. Pour into covered container of your choice (pint jar w/lid or condiment bottle with cap). Store in refrigerator and use as desired.

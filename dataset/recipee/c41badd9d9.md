### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of oats

 - 13 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 23 cup of honey

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 12 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 719283140692

 - 1 cup of nuts, walnuts, english

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spread oats onto an un-greased cookie sheet and bake for 15 minutes, stirring a couple of times. Mix oil, honey and vanilla in a large bowl. Add cooled oats, chocolate chips and nuts (if using) and mix well. (Note: If the oats are still warm at all, the chocolate chips will melt. ). Line a 9x13 baking dish with parchment paper and mist with oil. Spread the mixture evenly onto the parchment. Lay a sheet of waxed paper over the mixture and press to compact. (I use the palms of my hands to start, and then I use the bottom of a drinking glass to make the surface as smooth as possible. ). Remove the waxed paper and use a rubber spatula to press in any of the oats that may have "straggled" up the sides of the dish. Bake for 20 minutes. Cool completely and lift parchment from the dish. Cut into 16 bars.

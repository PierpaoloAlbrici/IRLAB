### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine the oat flour, cornmeal, rice flour, barley flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, sunflower seeds, and currants; mix well. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture, add the oil and barley malt/brown rice syrup. Add a little soy milk and begin to mix, by hand or using medium speed with electric mixer. Add only enough of the soy milk to hold dough together, so it is not crumbly dry, but is not like liquid. Drop about 2 tablespoons of the dough at a time onto lightly greased tray and bake 15 to 20 minutes, or until browned. Makes 12 biscuits.

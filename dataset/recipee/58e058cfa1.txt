Applecot Sauce (Apples & Apricots)


Ingredients


 - 14 pound of apricots, dried, sulfured, uncooked


 - 1 1/2 pound of apples, raw, with skin


 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Wash apricots and soak for 4 hours in enough water to cover. Peel, core and slice the washed apples. In a medium saucepan, simmer the apricots and the soaking water for 10 minutes. Put apple slices on top of the simmering apricots, cover and simmer until the apples are tender, approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Thoroughly mix the sugar with the fruits and simmer 2 minutes longer. Serve hot or cold, strained or unstrained, as desired.

Cheddar-Oat Griddle Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of oats


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 3 tablespoon of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


 - 1 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 1/4 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


Instructions: 

Combine the first 4 (dry) ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir together. Work the margarine into the flour mixture with the tines of a fork or a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the cheese, then add enough rice milk to hold the mixture together as a firm dough, working it together with your hands. Turn out onto a well-floured board and roll the dough out to a 1/4-inch thickness. Cut the dough into 2-inch rounds with a cookie cutter or the rim of a glass. Gather up leftover dough, roll out, and cut until all the dough has been used up. Heat a griddle or large nonstick skillet that has been sprayed with cooking oil spray. Cook the biscuits on both sides over medium heat until golden brown. Cool on a plate, then transfer to an airtight container when cooled to room temperature.

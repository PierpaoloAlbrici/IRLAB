Sweet and Spicy Candied Nuts


Ingredients


 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, pistachio nuts, raw


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Start by adding the butter into a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Add in the brown sugar, salt and cayenne pepper as the butter is melting and mix thoroughly together. Once the butter is completely melted, pour in your nuts, stirring until completely coated. Line a sheet pan/baking sheet with parchment paper and spread the nuts out in a single layer. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven for 18 minutes, tossing once at the halfway mark. Remove pan from oven. Let the nuts cool until they are cool to the touch. Break the nuts into small clusters and transfer to a bowl. Add the granulated sugar and toss to combine. Inspired by Cooking Light Magazine.

Instructions: 

Heat vegetable oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the slivered almonds and stir until they are golden brown. Remove almonds from pan and set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the Dijon mustard, lemon juice and Sherry vinegar. Add the capers, caper juice. Slowly whisk in the olive oil and set aside. Bring about a quart of water to a boil in a large. Add salt. Prepare an ice bath by filling a bowl large enough to hold the green beans with cold water. Add some ice cubes and put a colander in the middle of the bowl. Stir the green beans into the boiling water and allow them to cook, 2-3 minutes or until crisp-tender. Use a slotted spoon to remove them from the water, transferring them immediately to the colander inside the ice bath. Allow them to sit in the ice bath for a few minutes, swirling them gently in the water to assure they are all cooling. Transfer the green beans to a kitchen towel spread on a flat surface and thoroughly dry them. Place dried green beans into a medium bowl. Toss with the vinaigrette and the toasted almonds. Serve immediately.

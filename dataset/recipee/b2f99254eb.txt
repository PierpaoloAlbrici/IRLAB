Mint-Chocolate Truffles (Lowfat)


Ingredients


 - 13 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 4 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 16 ounce of sugars, powdered


 - 1/4 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, powdered


 - 2 tablespoon of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

Place 13 cup morsels in a medium glass bowl, and microwave at high 1 minute or until morsels are almost melted, stirring until smooth. Let cool. Add the softened cream cheese to melted morsels, and beat at medium speed of a mixer until smooth. Add 1 (16 oz.) package powdered sugar to cheese mixture; beat until well-blended. Press mixture into a 6-inch square on heavy-duty plastic wrap, and cover with additional plastic wrap. Chill at least 1 hour. Remove top sheet of plastic wrap; cut mixture into 48 squares. Roll each square into a ball, and place on wax paper. Roll half of balls in cocoa; roll remaining balls in 1/4 cup powdered sugar. Place 2 tablespoons morsels in a heavy-duty zip-top plastic bag, and microwave at high 1 minute or until morsels are softened. Knead bag until smooth. Snip a tiny hole in corner of bag; drizzle chocolate over balls rolled in cocoa. Serve at room temperature. Note: Store truffles in a single layer in an airtight container in freezer for up to 1 month. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving.

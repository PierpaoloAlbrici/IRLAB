### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 4 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Place the water, sugar and yeast in the loaf pan of the bread machine. Let the yeast dissolve and foam for 10 minutes. Add the oil, flour and salt to the loaf pan. Select the Rapid Bake, Light Crust setting, and press Start. Help unstuck any flour from the sides during the first mix cycle. Add additional flour or liquid, if needed. I didn't need to. My bread machine has a 7 minute power failure backup feature. I unplug the bread machine during the last rise cycle for 5 minutes. This gives a lighter loaf when finished. When baked, the internal temperature should be between 190F and 200F. When finished baking, let cool 1 hour on a rack before storing in a plastic bag (I use a zip-lock). The loaf can be sliced and frozen, if desired.

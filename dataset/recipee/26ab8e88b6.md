### Ingredients

 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of oats

 - 3 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 12 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, brown

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

### Instructions

In a large saucepan, melt the butter and add the oats. Stir for 2 minutes to toast. Add the boiling water and reduce heat to a simmer. Keep at a low simmer for 25 minutes, without stirring. Alternately, after adding the boiling water,cover the saucepan and remove from the heat. Allow to sit overnight on the counter. In the morning, proceed as directed below. Combine the milk and the buttermilk (or yogurt) with the oatmeal. Stir gently to combine and cook for an additional 10 minutes. Spoon into a serving bowl and top with additional milk or buttermilk, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Feel free to garnish or sweeten as desired: chunky applesauce or fruit conserves are great, as is maple syrup, or add dried fruit to the oats and soak both overnight - sweetens the oats ever so slightly.

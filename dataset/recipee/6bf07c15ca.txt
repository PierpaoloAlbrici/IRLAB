Crunchy Butter Cookies


Ingredients


 - 200 g of butter, without salt


 - 200 ml of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of syrups, sugar free


 - 500 ml of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 3 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Mix the flour, soda and vanilla sugar. Foam the butter, sugar and syrup by hand in a separate container. Add the flour mixture to the foam and mix into a dough. Separate the dough into flat bars. Oven cook for 10 minutes at 200C (400F). Cut the cooked dough to pieces. The dough should still be soft at this stage. Leave the cookies to cool and harden in room temperature. To achieve maximum crunchiness, allow them to harden overnight.

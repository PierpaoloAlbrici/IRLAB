### Ingredients

 - 2 1/2 pound of chicken, broilers or fryers, wing, meat and skin, raw

 - 34 cup of vinegar, cider

 - 34 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, chili powder

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, onion powder

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

### Instructions

Preheat grill to medium (if using gas grill), or until charcoal is covered with gray ash and is medium-hot. Meanwhile, combine vinegar, sugar, pepper sauce, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder and cayenne to make hot sauce; mix well. Set aside 3/4 cup of mixture to serve as dipping sauce; use remaining for basting. Place frozen chicken on grill. Brush with basting sauce. Grill for 15 minutes (10 minutes for wings), basting often. Turn chicken over and baste again. Basting often, grill for 15 to 20 minutes more (10 to 15 minutes for wings) or until internal juices run clear. Discard leftover basting sauce. Serve chicken with reserved hot sauce.

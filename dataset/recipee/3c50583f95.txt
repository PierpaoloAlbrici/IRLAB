Cornmeal Pancakes (Eggless)


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 teaspoon of butter, salted


 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 13 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Cream the cornmeal, salt, and butter together. Add the milk and enough water to make a moist but firm batter. Drop, using about 1/4 cup of batter, onto a hot greased griddle, and flatten using the back of a spoon wetted with water. This can be a tad tricky, but wetting the spoon helps a lot! When brown, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot with maple syrup, honey, or butter.

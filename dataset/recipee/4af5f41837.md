### Ingredients

 - 14 cup of sweetener, syrup, agave

 - 14 cup of molasses

 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 1/2-2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Melt together agave, molasses and sugar over low heat until sugar is dissolved. Allow to cool slightly. Mix in spices, salt and enough flour to form a stiff dough. Take small amount of dough and roll into a ball, then flatten onto a sprayed baking sheet. Yield will depend on size; I like to make mine smallish so they're more crunchy. Bake about 5 mins, or until just set (they will firm as they cool). Less time will make softer cookies; longer will make them crunchier. Cookies will be very crunchy once they've cooled, but will soften in a few days so if you don't like really crunchy cookies leave a few days before eating (which also allows the spices to 'meld' more), If you want them glazed, use a hard icing of confectioners' sugar and water which makes them similar to lebkuchen, but I tend to leave mine plain coz I like dunking them in hot soymilk!

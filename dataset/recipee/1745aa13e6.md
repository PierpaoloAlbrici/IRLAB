### Instructions

In a large saucepan brown meat over medium heat, crumbling as you cook. Pour meat in to a strainer over a bowl. Reserve 1/2 cup fat and return meat to saucepan. In a medium saucepan heat fat over medium heat. When hot whisk in the 1/4 cup flour. Reduce heat to medium low, and continue to cook until a rich caramel color is reached, around 15 minutes. Add beef broth and whisk well. Remove from heat. In the meat saucepan add water to the cooked beef. Whisk in remaining flour. Add the roux/broth and remaining ingredients. Heat to medium high stirring often. Once a gentle boil is reached, reduce to medium low and simmer for 20 minutes, again, stirring often. Remove from heat and let stand 30 minutes to thicken.

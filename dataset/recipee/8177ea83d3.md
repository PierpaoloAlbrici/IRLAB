### Ingredients

 - 8 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

 - 2 teaspoon of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat

 - 14 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

Pour milk into a large sauce pot over medium-high heat. Heat the milk, stirring occasionally, until it reaches 180 degrees. Remove from heat and cool to between 110-120 degrees, still stirring occasionally. Once the temperature reaches that range, add the yogurt and milk powder. Whisk until smooth and then pour into a bowl with a lid. Wrap in thick kitchen towels and place in a preheated oven. (You can preheat it to any temp, you just want the oven to be warm to keep the yogurt warm). Allow it to sit undisturbed in the oven for 8-12 hours (I left it for a little over 13 hours with no problem). Remove it from the oven and strain in a mesh strainer or colander lined with a coffee filter or paper towels (you can also use cheese cloth, I just never have any). Drain for about an hour or two depending on how dry you like your yogurt. Place in a lidded storage container and keep in the fridge for up to a week.

Delicious Microwave Peanut Butter Fudge


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 14 cup of oil, corn, peanut, and olive


Instructions: 

Grease an 8 x 8-inch baking dish. Place the butter and the peanut butter in a medium-size microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 2 minutes on HIGH (I use my 8-cup Pyrex measuring cup for this). Remove and stir with a spoon then return back and cook on HIGH for another 2 minutes. Whisk/mix in the confectioners vigorously until combined and smooth (this might take a few minutes). Mix in the chopped roasted nuts. Cool to about room temperature, then chill until firm. Cut into small squares.

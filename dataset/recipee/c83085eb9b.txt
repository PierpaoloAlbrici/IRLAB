Chocolate Raspberry Truffles With Fresh Raspberries


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of raspberries, raw


 - 1 pound of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022


 - 1 1/2 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


Instructions: 

Pass the berries through a food mill fitted with a fine disk or force them through a through a fine sieve, mashing with a wooden spoon, into a medium bowl. You'll have about 1/2 cup raspberry puree; set it aside and discard the contents of the strainer. Put the chopped chocolate in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan, heat the cream, just until boiling. Pour the hot cream over the chopped chocolate; whisk to blend. Stir in the raspberry puree and the salt. Refrigerate the mixture until completely chilled, about 1 hour. Pour the cocoa powder onto a plate. With a melon-baller or spoon, scoop the chocolate-raspberry mixture and shape it into 1-inch balls. If the truffles are very soft, put them on a baking sheet and refrigerate briefly to firm. Roll the shaped truffles in the cocoa, coating them thoroughly. If sealed and refrigerated, these truffles will keep for about 1 week.

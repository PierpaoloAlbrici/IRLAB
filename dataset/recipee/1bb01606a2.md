### Ingredients

 - 1 1/2-2 pound of fish, salmon, atlantic, wild, raw

 - 14 cup of sauce, pesto, ready-to-serve, refrigerated

 - 12 cup of nuts, pistachio nuts, raw

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350F Take four salmon fillets (do NOT use salmon steaks!) of about 6-7 oz. each and put them on a cookie sheet that has been sprayed with Pam or brushed with olive oil to prevent sticking. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of Butoni pesto (in the grocery store refrigerated section) onto the top of each filet and spread evenly. Take the pistachios (shell the nuts, put in a baggie and whack with the side of a meat tenderizer/pounder) and cover the pesto with them. The amounts of pesto and pistachios depend on the size of the fillets, so use your judgment here. Bake for about 20-22 minutes until done. Serve immediately. (I serve it with roasted baby red potatoes and asparagus. ).

## Mock Nutella

[a736b1bcc0](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/homemade-ingredients/mock-nutella/)

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of nuts, hazelnuts or filberts

 - 1/4 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 2 tablespoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 2 teaspoon of oil, corn, peanut, and olive

### Instructions

Grind the hazelnuts in a food processor until creamy. This should take 5-10 minutes, and you will need to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl a few times to make sure it all blends well. Add the sugar and cocoa powder, processing until well-mixed. Scrape down the sides of the processor, then continue to blend. While the food processor is running, slowly add in the oil. Process for a minute more, then transfer to a serving bowl or storage container. Will store well at room temperature for 4-5 days ... if it even lasts that long.

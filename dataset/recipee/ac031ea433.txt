Blueberry Lemonade


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of blueberries, raw


 - 1 cup of lemon juice, raw


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 gallon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

To make the blueberry juice simmer as many quarts of blueberries as you want with just enough water to cover. I usually use two quarts. Simmer for 1/2 hour and extract the juice from the berries by pouring the mixture through a fine mesh sieve. Save the rest of the juice for your next gallon of lemonade. Mix 1 cup of blueberry juice and 1 cup of lemon juice in a gallon container. Stir in the 2 cups of sugar, stirring to dissolve. Then add enough water to make one gallon. Mammys Cupboard serves this in mason jars with lots of ice. Enjoy!

Basic Barbecue Rub


Ingredients


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1/4 cup of spices, paprika


 - 3 tablespoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 3 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, onion powder


 - 2 teaspoon of celery, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


Instructions: 

Combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir to mix. (Actually, your hands work better for mixing than a spoon or whisk does. Use your fingers to break up any lump of brown sugar.) Store the rub in an airtight jar away from heat or light; it will keep for at least 6 months.

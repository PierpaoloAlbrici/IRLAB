How To Make Your Own Apple Cider Vinegar


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of vinegar, cider


 - 4 1/2 cup of apples, raw, with skin


Instructions: 

Place the vinegar and the apple cider in a crock or jar make sure the crock does not have lead-based paint and is food grade. It should hold at least a gallon with enough extra room for air circulation. Cover the opening with a cloth or cotton tea towel. Place in a warm spot (68 to 70 degrees F) for 1 to 2 months. Check it occasionally and sniff it. It will gradually take on a distinct vinegar smell and you will notice a slight film on the top. When the mixture tastes and smells like vinegar, pour a third and place it in airtight bottles. Save the culture and extra vinegar and replace with equal amounts of apple cider and start the process again. The process will take less time so check it often. Mine has been done as quickly as two weeks. You can also bottle all of it and throw away the culture.

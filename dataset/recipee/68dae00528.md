[68dae00528](http://www.food.com/recipe/easy-30-minute-pizza-dough-ii-421634)

### Ingredients

 - 34 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 12 teaspoon of honey

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 12 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

### Instructions

In a large bowl, place the warm water in first then the honey. Sprinkle the yeast on top, agitate the bowl slightly if you have to so the yeast gets immersed in the water. Wait 10-15 minutes or until foamy. Add the oil and salt. Blend in the flours and knead until elasticy, about 5 minutes or so. Cover with parchment paper or a dish towel and let rise for 20-30 minutes. Spray a cookie sheet, pizza stone, or round baking dish with cooking spray and put some dough in and you're set! I get about 3-4 little pizzas out of this amount of dough; it's thicker than my other pizza dough recipe.

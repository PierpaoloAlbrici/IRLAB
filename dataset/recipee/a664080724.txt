Sesame Cheese Crackers


Ingredients


 - 2 1/4 ounce of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried


 - 12 pound of cheese, cheddar


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 dash of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 400 F degrees. Place last 5 ingredients in a small bowl. Leave out until room temp. Toast seeds on low heat in heavy fry pan stirring constantly (15 min or so). Work dough until well mixed. (I use my hands, other prefer a pastry blender.) Add seeds& mix just until incorporated. Roll dough on floured board until 1/8 in. thick. Use a knife and cut into squares or use (cookie) cutters to make fancier shapes. Place on baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes. Store in airtight container.

Mango Scones


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 5 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 1/2 cup of mango nectar, canned


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 375 degrees . Lightly spray a scone pan/baking sheet with non-stick spray. (Skip this step if you use a well-loved Pampered Chef pizza stone for your scones like I do.) In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Cut in butter with pastry blender or fork until crumbly. Stir in whipping cream. Add mango. On a lightly floured surface, knead dough 5 or 6 times. Roll dough into a 1/2-inch thick circle. Cut into eight triangles. Place dough triangles on prepared pan. Brush tops with either a little cream or an egg wash. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.

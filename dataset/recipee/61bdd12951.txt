Artichoke Dip


Ingredients


 - 16 ounce of artichokes, (globe or french), raw


 - 1 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 1 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular


 - 1 dash of salt, table


Instructions: 

Mix all in a Microwave safe bowl. Microwave until all ingredients mix smoothly. Put on your favorite cracker! I like to add some finely diced onions and a little Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning to taste. You can put more or less artichoke hearts in this recipe - depends on your liking!

### Ingredients

 - 14 cup of butter, without salt

 - 12 cup of onions, raw

 - 2 1/2 teaspoon of spices, curry powder

 - 28 ounce of tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average

 - 4 cup of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry

 - 12 cup of cream, sour, cultured

### Instructions

General Note: I use Pam olive oil spray instead of butter, and low-fat sour cream. Melt butter in saucepan. Saute onion until tender. Add curry powder and cook an additional minute to blend flavors. Stir in tomatoes and broth. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes. Add 1/2 cup sour cream and let it melt into the soup. With a whisk, beat until smooth.

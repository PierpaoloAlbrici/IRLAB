### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place all the ingredients in a medium-size bowl and toss until the nuts are well coated. Transfer to the prepared sheet and arrange in a single layer. Place in oven and cook until the nuts begin to color, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel to drain and set aside to cool before serving. Pine nuts are also great cooked this way. Keep your eye on these to be sure the garlic doesn't burn.

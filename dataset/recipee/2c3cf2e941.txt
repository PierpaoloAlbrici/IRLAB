Put in a food processor or blender with the mustard and puree until smooth. Gently stir into stew. CROCKPOT DIRECTIONS: This can be prepared the night before and refrigerated in the crockpot liner. Before leaving for work in the morning, toss the liner into the heating unit and don't forget to turn on Low. Brown meat and saute onions and garlic in oil as directed. While these are browning, prepare the vegetables and put in bottom of crockpot. Add the browned onion and garlic and then the meat (on top). Sprinkle seasonings over all. Pour the cider on, and cover and cook for 10 or 12 hours on Low, until meat and vegetables are tender. About 15 minutes before serving, check the amount of liquid in the stew. Quite a bit should have accumulated, but add some or all of the water to make as much sauce as desired. Thicken with pureed vegetables and liquid as directed, turning the crockpot to High after returning the vegetable thickener to the mixture.

Pastry Dough


Ingredients


 - 1 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 3-5 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Blend together flour, butter, sugar, and salt in a bowl with your fingertips or a pastry blender (or pulse in a food processor) just until mixture resembles coarse meal with some small (roughly pea-size) butter lumps. Drizzle 3 tablespoons ice water evenly over mixture and gently stir with a fork (or pulse) until incorporated. Squeeze a small handful of dough: If it doesnt hold together, add more ice water, 1/2 tablespoon at a time, stirring (or pulsing) until incorporated. Do not overwork dough, or pastry will be tough. Gather all dough together with pastry scraper. Press into a ball, then flatten into a 5-inch disk. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill until firm, at least 1 hour. If youre making two desserts that call for this pastry dough, you can make a double batch. Pastry dough can be chilled up to 2 days or frozen, wrapped well, up to 3 months.

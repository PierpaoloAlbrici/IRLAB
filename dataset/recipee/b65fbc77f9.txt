Power Oatmeal With Blueberries and Flax


Ingredients


 - 14 cup of oats


 - 1 tablespoon of seeds, flaxseed


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 3/4-1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 12 scoop of beverages, protein powder whey based


 - 12 cup of blueberries, raw


Instructions: 

Combine oats, flax and cinnamon. Add water and mix well. Don't add the protein powder or it will become overcooked-yick! Microwave for one minute. **Microwave times given are for a 1300wt microwave, you will probably need more time if you have a smaller wattage microwave. **. Remove bowl from microwave and stir in protein powder. Return to microwave and set timer for 2 minutes, stirring every 20-30 seconds until your desired consistency is reached. *Watch carefully because the protein powder will puff and you don't want a mess! Add blueberries and stir - I like warm blueberries so I return the bowl to the microwave for another 15-20 seconds. Sprinkle with a little cinnamon.

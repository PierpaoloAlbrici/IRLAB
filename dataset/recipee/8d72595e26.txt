Caramel Sauce for Custard Cream


Ingredients


 - 100 g of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 to 4 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Put the granulated sugar and water into a small pan, and start heating over medium heat. Put 2 to 4 tablespoons of water in a heatproof container, and microwave for about 30 seconds to bring it to a boil. As you shake the pan occasionally, it will start to brown from the edges as shown in the photo. From this point on, don't leave the pan! Prepare the boiling water! Keep shaking the pan and don't take your eyes off it! When it reaches the color shown in the photo here, it just needs a little bit more! Turn the heat off at this point and keep agitating the pan. When the caramel is as dark as shown in this photo, add the boiling water all at once. It will splatter, so be careful of burns! The caramel sauce is done! It can be kept in a sterilized jar for 2 to 3 months without any problems. Please try using it in the caramel custard pudding recipe from! If you add a bit more boiling water to the sauce you can use it on ice cream or panna cotta too. If you are using this for a caramel custard pudding, use 2 tablespoons of boiling water. To use as a sauce to pour over panna cotta or ice cream, add 4 tablespoons or so of boiling water.

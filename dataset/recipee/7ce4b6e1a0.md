### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 12 teaspoon of sugars, brown

 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw

### Instructions

Mix milk and lemon. Combine dry ingredients. Add milk and lemon mixture (buttermilk may be used instead). On floured bread board (I use whole wheat) knead dough for no more than a minute. Shape dough into a circle with a height of about two inches. Place on lightly oiled baking sheet. With (sharp) floured knife, cut an x nearly halfway through the dough. Bake about 40 minutes in 400F degrees degree oven. Dough should sound hollow when tapped with knuckles or handle of spoon. Place loaf on wire rack and let rest at least an hour before slicing.

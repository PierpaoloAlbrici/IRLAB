### Ingredients

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, onion powder

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, thyme, dried

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, basil, dried

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, oregano, dried

 - 1 teaspoon of parsley, fresh

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 2 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Crush the Ritz crackers into crumbs (I use a Ninja for this step). Add all of the seasonings to the crushed Ritz crackers in a shallow bowl and mix well. Remove about half of the crushed cracker/seasoning mixture and reserve for another use. Place each strip of chicken in the crushed cracker/seasoning mixture and coat well using a spoon. Place the coated chicken strips on a cookie sheet coated with foil sprayed with Pam. Once all of the chicken strips are coated and placed on the cookie sheet, cut the stick of butter into small pieces and tuck butter between the chicken strips and around the outside edge of the pan. Bake the chicken at 350 for 20 minutes; flip it and bake for 20 minutes longer,.

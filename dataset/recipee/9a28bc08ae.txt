Barbecued Short Ribs of Beef


Ingredients


 - 4 pound of pork, fresh, loin, country-style ribs, separable lean only, raw


 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 cup of vinegar, cider


 - 1 cup of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 2 quart of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Season the ribs with salt and pepper. Put them into a large bowl and add the vinegar and soy sauce . Marinate at room temperature 1 to 2 hours, or covered in the refrigerator overnight, turning the ribs occasionally. Preheat the oven to 350F (180C). Remove the ribs from the marinade and place in an 18x12 inch roasting pan. Pour in the water and bake, covered, until tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Pour off and discard the cooking liquid. Baste the ribs well with barbecue sauce. Return the pan to the oven and bake, basting with barbecue sauce once or twice, until well browned, about 30 minutes. Serve hot, passing extra sauce separately.

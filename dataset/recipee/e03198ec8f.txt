Egyptian Dukka 2


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of nuts, pistachio nuts, raw


 - 1 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, coriander seed


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, cumin seed


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, thyme, dried


 - 14 cup of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Toast the pistachios and almonds in the oven for about 15 minutes, stirring every 3-4 minutes. Don't let them burn. Set aside. Toast the coriander seed and the cumin seed in a dry nonstick skillet for a couple of minutes, shaking pan, until they release their fragrance. Set aside. Toast the sesame seeds in the dry nonstick skillet for a couple of minutes, just until lightly toasted. Shake pan as you toast them. Set aside. When everything is back to room temperature, add it all to a food processor and pulse until it is the texture of bread crumbs. It should look dry. Don't overprocess, or the nuts will release their oil and it will get moist and it will be like a paste, which you don't want.

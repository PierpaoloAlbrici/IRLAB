### Ingredients

 - 5 1/2 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table

 - 2 1/2 teaspoon of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 16 ounce of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

### Instructions

Place all dry ingredients in the mixer bowl but dont turn on mixer. In a separate container, place the warm water and add the oil first and then the honey, using the same measuring spoon, as the oil will keep the honey from sticking to the spoon. Stir the liquids together and stir them, then turn on the mixer with dough hook installed to low speed for 15 seconds. Then add the liquid mixture all at once and turn the mixer to its lowest speed for about a minute and a halfuntil ingredients are pretty well together and shut it off. Let it rest this way for 10 minutes. Turn the mixer to the second speed and let it run 3 minutes. Remove the dough hook and turn the dough onto a floured board or table. Knead 3 or 4 times to get the air bubbles out. Place it in an oiled bowl (you can put it back in the mixer bowl) and put it in a warm place, like your oven with a cloth draped over it for 1 hour. At the end of the hour, punch it down and turn it onto the floured surface and knead another three or four times. Form loaves and put into 2 loaf pans. Put them in the same warm place with a cloth draped over them and let them rise 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees and bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until crust is the color you like. If you put a small pan of water on the rack below the bread, it will make the crust softer and chewier. Remove from pans and let cool at least 30 minutes on a wire rack. I usually brush the tops with olive oil because it softens the crust a bit and makes the loaves look nice. This bread has a wonderful flavor and keeps very well.

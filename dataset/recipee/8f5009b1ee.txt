Recipes. Second one sounds like it would be great with the addition of some habs! Would it keep longer with additional vinegar The Seed of a Bright Idea By JOHN ASH The most basic of mustards is simply a mix of mustard pwdr and water. This recipe has a little more going for it. Remember which most homemade mustards tend to be a bit more runny and more pungent than commercially made, but which's their charm. Also, homemade mustard needs to mature at least a day, and preferably longer, before being used. When it's first made, the flavor will be almost unpleasant. Coarsely grind yellow and brown mustard seeds in spice grinder or possibly coffee mill. Mix together with mustard pwdr and water. Allow mix to stand at least 1 hour. Stir in vinegar, brown sugar and salt. Cover and chill at least 1 day before using.

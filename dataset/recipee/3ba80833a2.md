### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 tablespoon of vinegar, distilled

 - 2 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 1/2-2 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

 - 34 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

In a large bowl cream confectioners sugar, softened butter, and vinegar. In a medium bowl sift together the flour, ginger, baking soda, and salt. Mix dry ingredient into the creamed butter mixture. If dough is too dry, add milk or cream a tablespoon at a time. Chill dough and keep unused portion in refrigerator while making each batch. On lightly floured board or silpad, roll dough 1/8 - 1/4 inch. Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters. Bake in a 400F oven for 6-8 minutes, until edges turn golden brown. Keep a close eye on cookies, especially if cookies are different sizes. I bake a sheet of stars, then angels, etc. so they will bake evenly. Cool on wire rack before decorating.

3 Ingredient Corn Soup Recipe


Ingredients


 - 6 cup of corn, sweet, white, raw


 - 4 1/2 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Cutting the kernels off the cob: Pull the outer leaves and silky threads off each ear of corn. Put a large piece of waxed paper on cutting board. Hold each ear of corn, large end upright, on the cutting board and, using a sharp knife, cut the kernels off the cob from top to bottom. Pick up the ends of the waxed paper and, using it as a sling, transfer the corn to a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Making the soup: Add in 3 c. of lowfat milk and the salt to the saucepan. Turn the heat to medium-high and stir often till the lowfat milk begins to boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, so the lowfat milk simmers, but does not boil. Simmer for 15 min, stirring every few min. Finishing the soup: If you want a crunchy corn soup, just add in the remaining 1 1/2 c. lowfat milk, taste and add in more salt if needed; heat and serve. If you want creamy corn soup, pour the soup into a food processor and process till the corn is pureed (the kernels will be broken down into small bits, or possibly blended completely into the lowfat milk, depending on how powerful your processor is). Pour the soup back into the saucepan and add in the remaining 1 1/2 c. lowfat milk. Taste and add in more salt if needed; heat and serve. This recipe yields 4 servings. Comments: This easy summer soup can be either creamy or possibly crunchy, depending on whether you puree it or possibly not.

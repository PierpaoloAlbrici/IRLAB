Homemade Chestnut Paste


Ingredients


 - 300 g of nuts, chestnuts, european, dried, peeled


 - 150 ml of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 50 ml of water, bottled, generic


 - 80 g of sugars, granulated


 - 1 tablespoon of alcoholic beverage, distilled, rum, 80 proof


Instructions: 

Wash the chestnuts, pour in enough water to cover them and cook them for 8-12 minutes in a pressure cooker. When the pressure has dropped, drain them in a sieve and spoon out the insides. Place all the ingredients except for the rum in a saucepan and mash the chestnuts as they simmer (simmer well until the water has evaporated). When it has cooled down, put the mixture in a food processor, and add the rum for the aroma and blend. Pour it into a sterilized container and it's done. Note: It has a lot of water but it is low in sugar, so it won't keep for very long. Refrigerate the amount you wish to use and freeze the rest. It's nice as a bread filling. It's also nice used in this recipe.

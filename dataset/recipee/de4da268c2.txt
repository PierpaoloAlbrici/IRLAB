Brown Swedish Cookies


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of honey


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


Instructions: 

Cream together Butter, Sugar and Honey. Then add flour and Baking Soda to make dough. Roll the dough into small balls and place on a baking sheet. Use a cookie press or the bottom of a drinking glass dipped in sugar to flatten the dough balls. Pre-heat an oven to 300F. Bake cookies for about 10 minutes (watch carefully, they burn easily). When cookies are light brown, remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool.

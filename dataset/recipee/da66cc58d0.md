### Ingredients

 - 150 g of nuts, almonds

 - 100 g of sugars, powdered

### Instructions

Mix the almonds and icing sugar and add in a tsp. or possibly so of orange flower water. Fold in just sufficient egg white to bind together to a hard paste which can be rolled out. It is easy to over-do the egg white, and you'll find which adding extra grnd almonds will help to dry the mix. Wrap in cling film and refrigeratefor an hour. Preheat the oven to 170C/325F/gas3. Roll out to about 1cm ( 1/2") thick, dusting the worktop and rolling pin with cornflour if necessary to stop the mix sticking. Cut with a heart-shaped cutter, place on a baking sheet lined with baking parchment or possibly rice paper, and bake for 15-20 min till pale gold. Cold on a wire rack and sift icing sugar over the cakes before serving. NOTES : Makes around 30

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of peppers, sweet, green, raw

 - 1 cup of vinegar, cider

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

Wearing rubber gloves, fill a 14oz glass jar with stemmed Thai chile peppers to within about an inch from the top. In small saucepan, bring vinegar, salt, and sugar to a boil, stirring until salt and sugar are dissolved (about 2-3 mins). Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Pour hot mixture over peppers in jar. Cover and chill 3 weeks. NOTE: Chilling for three weeks allows the peppers to fire up the vinegar mixture. The longer it sits, the zippier it gets! NOTE #2: Wearing rubber gloves when working with hot peppers is a good idea!

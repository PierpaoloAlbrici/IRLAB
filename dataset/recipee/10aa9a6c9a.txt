Double Chocolate Pudding


Ingredients


 - 3/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/3 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


 - 3 tablespoon of cornstarch


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 3 ounce of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

In a medium saucepan, whisk together the sugar, cocoa, cornstarch, and salt. Gradually whisk in 1 cup of the cream until smooth, then whisk in the remaining 1 cup cream. Set the pan over medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens and comes to a boil, about 5 minutes. Continue to whisk and boil for 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat and add the chocolate and vanilla. Let stand for 5 minutes until the chocolate is melted, then stir gently until the pudding is smooth. (Do not stir too much or the pudding might thin out.) Divide the pudding among 6 small dessert dishes. Let cool for about 20 minutes to serve warm and soft, or chill for at least 30 minutes or up to 8 hours.

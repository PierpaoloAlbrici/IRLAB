Peanut Butter Fudge


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 pound of sugars, powdered


Instructions: 

Get a medium sized glass baking dish (or whatever dish you want to use) and line with either aluminum foil or parchment paper. Spray with a nonstick cooking spray. *Tip: To make it easier, flip pan over to shape the aluminum foil or parchment paper and then turn the pan back over and fit the paper inside. Set up a double boiler at medium heat , and add the butter and peanut butter. While you're waiting for the peanut butter mixture to start melting, add together the powdered sugar and vanilla in another separate bowl. (You don't have to mix this together just yet) Go back to your double boiler and mix the peanut butter mixture here and there until it's completely smooth and well combined. Once it's completely smooth and mixed together, dump the peanut butter mixture into the bowl with the powdered sugar and mix by hand until well combined. After mixing, dump into your pan of choice and smooth the top using a back of a spoon or rubber spatula. Cover the dish with a lid or foil and put into fridge. Let it firm up at least 2 hours and then serve. This dessert is very rich so 1 inch cubes are a good size to cut them into. And there you go! Voila ENJOY!!! !

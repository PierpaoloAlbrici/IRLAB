### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow

 - 12 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, chili powder

 - 12 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 3 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw

### Instructions

Combine first 5 ingredients. Dip chicken pieces in milk. Then roll in cornmeal mixture. Place in a well greased 13x9 pan. Drizzle the butter over chicken. Bake uncovered in a preheated 375 degree oven for 50- 55 minutes. Note: I think chicken (fried or baked) tastes better if soaked for at least 4 hours in salt water. I use seasoned salt- about 3 Tbls. in a bowl of water big enough to hold chicken. Be sure to dry the chicken before using.

### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw

 - 13 cup of catsup

 - 1 teaspoon of sauce, worcestershire

 - 8 ounce of shortening, vegetable, household, composite

 - 1/4 cup of cheese, cheddar

 - 4 cup of potatoes, raw, skin

### Instructions

Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Place the beef in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat until no trace of pink remains, about 5 minutes. Spoon off and discard any fat. Stir in the ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. Add the vegetables and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Spoon the beef mixture into a baking dish. Mix the cheese (if using) with the prepared mashed potatoes in a medium bowl. Spread the potatoes over the beef and bake until heated through, 10 minutes. Divide among individual plates.

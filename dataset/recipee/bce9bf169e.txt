Greek Cheese Bread (Tiroposomo)


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 pound of cheese, feta


 - 14 ounce of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 12 teaspoon of honey


 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2-1 teaspoon of spices, oregano, dried


 - 3 1/2 ounce of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1/2-1 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Put the flour in a bowl and mix in the salt evenly. Mix the honey and the yeast with the 1/2 cup of water. Make a small dip in the center of the flour and add the yeast/honey water. Mix just a small amount of the flour into the yeast/honey water and cover the bowl and set it in a warm place for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, mix in the rest of the flour, along with enough additional water to make a soft, but not sticky dough. Mix the additional water in a little at a time. Gather the dough into a ball and turn it out onto a working surface and knead it until it is smooth and pliable (about 10 minutes). Put the dough back in the bowl, and cover it with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place until double in size. Brush a shallow oven dish with oil and place the dough into it. Flatten the dough out with your hands, to cover the bottom of the dish. Sprinkle the crumbled feta cheese evenly over the dough and press it in with your fingers. Sprinkle the oregano evenly over the cheese. Brush the edges of the dough with olive oil and pour the rest of the oil over the cheese. Let the dough rise uncovered for 30 mins and place in a preheated 450 oven for 30 mins, or until it has a golden color. Enjoy!

Prune and Orange Bread


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of orange juice, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 3/4 cup of orange juice, raw


 - 13 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 3/4 cup of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and orange peel, and stir to mix well. Add the Prune Butter and orange juice, and stir just until the dry ingredients are moistened. Fold in the pecans if desired. Coat an 8-x-4-inch loaf pan with non-stick cooking spray. Spread the mixture evenly in the pan, and bake at 350F (180C) F for about 40 minutes, or just until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean. Remove the bread from the oven and let sit for 10 minutes. Invert the loaf onto a wire rack, turn right side up, and cool before slicing and serving.

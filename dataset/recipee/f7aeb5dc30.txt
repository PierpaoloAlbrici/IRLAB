Chicken Livers With Mushrooms


Ingredients


 - 12 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


 - 10 ounce of mushrooms, white, raw


 - 14 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 18 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 teaspoon of parsley, fresh


 - 1 teaspoon of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry


Instructions: 

Boil water, add bouillon to dissolve, set aside. Melt margarine in 8 inch skillet. Brown livers over medium heat, stirring occasionally for 3-4 minutes. Stir in mushrooms (with liquid) Add bouillon/water, flour, salt(if using), pepper and parsley. Heat to boiling. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered Stir occasionally until livers are done, about 5 minutes. I usually use fresh sliced mushrooms as I don't really care for canned. Sorry, I'm not sure of the exact amount I use, I just add until it looks like enough -- oh, and I add about another 1/8 - 1/4 cup of water too if I use fresh mushrooms. I also add about 1/4 cup of diced onions and fry with liver for added flavour. I also do not add additional salt as I feel there is enough in the bouillon but the choice is yours.

Teatime Shortbread - Bon Appetit


Ingredients


 - 3/4 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 325F (160C). Using electric mixer, beat butter and sugar in bowl until well combined. Sift flour and salt into butter mixture. Using fingertips, rub mixture until moist clumps form. Gently knead until soft dough forms. Divide dough in half. Press out 1 dough piece to 9 1/2-inch round, about 1/4 inch thick. Roll lightly with rolling pin to smooth top. Using 3-inch-diameter cookie cutter, cut out 8 cookies. Reserve scraps. Repeat pressing, rolling and cutting with remaining dough piece. Gather dough scraps together. Press out dough scraps to form round and cut out additional cookies. Arrange cookies on 2 large baking sheets. Pierce each cookie several times with fork. Bake until pale golden, about 12 minutes. Cool slightly. Transfer cookies to racks; cool completely.

### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of potatoes, raw, skin

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 teaspoon of dill weed, fresh

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Slice potatoes thin (about 3/8 inch thick) I use my food processor for this. Place a thin layer of sliced potatoes in a 12 x 7 1/2 x 2 inch baking dish. Put small dots of butter on top of potatoes followed by the dill and salt. Cover with aluminium foil and bake at 425 degrees for 25 minutes or until potatoes are tender. After 15 minutes, stir potaotes to enhance flavor.

### Ingredients

 - 1 tablespoon of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, chili powder

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 15 ounce of chickpeas (garbanzo beans, bengal gram), mature seeds, raw

### Instructions

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F. In a bowl add: oil, garlic, chili powder, red pepper, salt and whisk everything well together. Add the chickpeas and toss to coat. Spray a baking sheet with non-stick spray or use parchment paper. Spread the chickpeas into a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast for 25 minutes, then turn the chickpeas and continue roasting for 20 minutes, until nicely browned and slightly crispy. Alternative: If you like a little sweet with your salt and spice, drizzle some honey over the chickpeas while they are hot. They taste great tossed in a salad as well.

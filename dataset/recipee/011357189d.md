### Ingredients

 - 2 teaspoon of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw

 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

### Instructions

Place the bouillon in the water and add rice. I like using the better then bouillon but haved used bouillon cubes also. You can also use white rice if you prefer. I like making this in the microwave but you can also cook it on the stove top. In the microwave I cook on high for about 17 minutes. Microwaves vary so keep on eye on the rice. Fluff rice and serve.

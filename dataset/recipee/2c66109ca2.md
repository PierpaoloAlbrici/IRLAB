### Ingredients

 - 34 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 1 dash of salt, table

 - 1 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1 3/4 cup of oats

 - 12 cup of nuts, pecans

 - 12 cup of candies, semisweet chocolate

 - 12 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 14 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

### Instructions

In a big bowl, combine flour, oats, baking soda, salt, brown sugar, walnuts and chocolate pieces. Add oil, water and vanilla. Mix to blend well. Drop by heaping teaspoonfuls onto greased baking sheets, about 2-inches apart since cookies will spread while baking. Bake at 350 for about 10 minutes for each baking sheet until lightly browned. Let cookies stand for about 1 minute. Loosen edges and carefully remove cookies to wire racks to cool. Tips: You may substitute raisins for chocolate pieces, if desired. Microwave Directions:. Drop onto microsafe baking dish or sheet, at least 2-inches apart and along outer part of sheet. Cookies will spread. Microwave at HIGH power for about 1 1/2 minutes until cookies have spread out on the sheet. Let cookies stand for about 1 or 1 1/2 minutes before removing from baking sheet or dish. Remember cookies will not get as crispy as in the regular oven but they are still very good with the chocolate pieces melted in the center.

Old-Fashioned Biscuits (From My Great Recipe Cards)


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 34 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar in a bowl. Cut in butter using pastry cutter or use 2 knives. With fork stir in buttermilk to make a soft dough (I have used an equal amount of buttermilk powder with added water and it works wonderfully in this recipe. Turn out onto lightly floured workspace and knead no more than 10 times to form a ball (if you over do it the biscuits can be tough). Roll into a 6" x 6" square. Place on ungreased baking sheet. Cut into 12 portions but do not separate. Bake at 400 F for 15 minutes or until golden brown. Serve with butter, honey, jam, or gravy.

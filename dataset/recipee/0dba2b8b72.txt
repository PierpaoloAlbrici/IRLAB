Pecan-Butterscotch Tuiles


Ingredients


 - 4 tablespoon of butter, salted


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1/4 cup of syrups, corn, light


 - 1/4 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 6 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 400F (200C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. (Dont use silicone baking mats because the cookies may be difficult to remove.) Set a rolling pin for shaping the tuiles on a folded dish towel to steady it and have ready a wire rack. In a small saucepan, warm the butter, brown sugar, and corn syrup over low heat until melted and smooth. Stir in the pecans and flour. Drop level tablespoons of batter on the prepared baking sheets, placing only 4 on each sheet and spacing them evenly apart. Slightly flatten the batter with dampened fingers. Bake one sheet at a time, rotating the baking sheet midway during baking, until the cookies are deep golden brown, about 7 minutes. Let cool briefly, about 1 minute. Using a metal spatula, lift each cookie off the baking sheet and drape it over the rolling pin. (If the cookies cool and harden before you have time to shape them, they can be softened by putting them back in the oven for 30 to 45 seconds.) Let cool on the rolling pin, then transfer the tuiles to a wire rack. Repeat with the remaining batter. Serve the tuiles within a few hours of baking. The batter can be made up to 1 week in advance and stored in the refrigerator. You can store the baked tuiles in an airtight container until ready to serve later the same day. You can substitute toasted almonds or walnuts for the pecans.

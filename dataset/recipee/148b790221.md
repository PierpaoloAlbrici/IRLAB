### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of potatoes, raw, skin

 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1/2 cup of onions, raw

 - 4 ounce of corn, sweet, white, raw

### Instructions

Peel the potatoes and grate them on the large holes of a box grater. Place a fine-mesh strainer over a medium bowl and transfer the grated potatoes to the strainer. Add the salt and pepper and toss to combine; set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a medium nonstick pan over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and cook until soft, about 4 minutes. Sprinkle half of the potatoes over the onions and stir to combine. Press with a spatula into an even layer. Sprinkle all of the corned beef or pastrami evenly over the potatoes, then top with the remaining potatoes and press again with the spatula to form a large potato cake. Cook undisturbed until the underside is golden, about 10 to 12 minutes. To flip the rosti, slide it out of the pan onto a large plate. Place a second large plate over the potatoes and invert. Return the pan to medium heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Slide the rosti back into the pan, reshape if necessary with the spatula, and cook the second side until golden, about 10 to 12 minutes. Slide onto a cutting board, slice, and serve.

BBQ Baby Back Ribs - Pressure Cooker


Ingredients


 - 2 pound of pork, fresh, loin, country-style ribs, separable lean only, raw


 - 2 cup of sauce, barbecue


Instructions: 

Place the metal rack in your cooker and add 1/2 cup of water (I used 1 cup as the manufacturer of my electric cooker recommends). If your cooker is large enough you can bend the racks around in a circle. Otherwise cut into sections and stand them upright in the cooker. Lock the lid in place. Bring to 15psi (high pressure in electric cooker) and cook for 12 minutes. Remove from heat and use quick release method to depressurize. When pressure drops, carefully open lid and use long tongs to remove ribs. Cover with sauce by dipping in sauce in a shallow pan, or basting well as you broil or BBQ the ribs to complete.

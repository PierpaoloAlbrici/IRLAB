Egg & Dairy-Free "Foolproof Bread Rolls"


Ingredients


 - 300 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 4 g of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 10 g of sugars, granulated


 - 200 ml of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


Instructions: 

In a bowl, add the ingredients. Pour in 80% of the lukewarm water. Check the consistency of the dough and add more water if necessary. Add the salt. Once the dough looks like the consistency that you see in the photo, start kneading with your hand. It is sticky at first, but it will get less sticky. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes. Strike it against the bowl occasionally. When you stretch the dough, it is elastic and you can see through, the kneading is done. It should be as soft as your earlobes. Once the kneading is done, roll it into a ball and let it rise. Cover with a tightly wrung damp cloth and leave it for 40 minutes. When the dough doubles in size, check it with your finger. (Press a finger into the center of the dough. If your finger leaves a hole that stays unchanged, it is done rising.) Remove the trapped air out of the dough by gently pressing it. Divide the dough into 7 equal pieces, place them onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper, cover with a tightly wrung out damp cloth and let sit for 5 minutes. Reshape the dough into a ball and let it rise for the second time. Cover the dough with tightly wrung out damp cloth and proof it for about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180C. When the dough rises to about 1.5 times its original size, and when you press it down, it leaves a mark, it is done proofing. Bake in the preheated oven at 180C for 10-15 minutes. The baking time varies by the oven. Check and adjust the baking time. Once the rolls are golden brown they are done.

### Ingredients

 - 50 g of pancakes, plain, dry mix, complete (includes buttermilk)

 - 1 teaspoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 1 teaspoon of honey

 - 1 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 30 to 36 g of beans, snap, green, raw

 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, powdered

 - 1 dash of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Divide the tsubu-an into 10-12 g portions and roll into balls. Put the ingredients in a bowl. First add just 1 tablespoon of milk and mix, then check the consistency of the dough. If it's dry, add a tiny bit more milk. Knead the dough until it's shiny and doesn't stick to your hands. Take 6 small bits of dough and roll them into balls to form the ears. Divide the rest of the dough into 3 pieces. Flatten one of the 3 pieces of dough on your hand, and put a piece of the tsubu-an on top. Gather the dough around the tsubu-an ball. Close up the dough and roll to form a ball. Form the face into an oval and place on a piece of parchment paper. Press the ears on the face ball. Bake for 10 minutes at 320F/160 C. Done! Cool the buns on a rack. Add a tiny bit of water to the powdered sugar to make stiff icing. Draw faces on the buns using a toothpick. It looks like this. The bun is finished. Please draw a face that you like. I think you could make a panda, or a Hello Kitty. I'll try it those out when I have time. Put into a case made for Japanese sweets... it looks like something sold in a store! If the buns harden the next day, microwave for 5 seconds and they'll become soft and fluffy again.

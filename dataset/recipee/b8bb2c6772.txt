Savory Curried Rice With Dried Fruit


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 1 cup of dates, deglet noor


 - 1 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 12 cup of raisins, seeded


 - 2 tablespoon of onions, raw


 - 4 teaspoon of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry


 - 4 teaspoon of spices, curry powder


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

In a large bowl, combine the first 8 ingredients. You can do this a day or two in advance to allow flavors to meld, but it's not necessary. Combine water and butter in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Add 2 cups rice mix, reduce heat, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until liquid is absorbed. NOTE: I make this a complete meal by adding cooked chicken thighs. You can store this rice mix in an airtight container for up to 3 months.

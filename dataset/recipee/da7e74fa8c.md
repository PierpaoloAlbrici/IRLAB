### Instructions

Mix yeast and warm water. Let sit for five minutes or until foamy. Add flour, salt and sugar to mixture. Mix well. Knead on floured surface for six minutes. You may need to add flour until dough is tacky but not sticky. Let dough rise in an oiled bowl covered with a tea towel for 1 hour. Separate into twelve balls. Roll each out into half inch wide ropes. Twist into a pretzel shape by forming a U then crossing ends and pressing ends onto the bottom of the U. Let pretzels rest for 15 minutes. Dissolve baking soda in a bowl if hot water. After pretzels have rested, put them one at a time into the baking soda solution. Let each soak for 30 seconds, flipping halfway through if not fully submerged. Put drip dried pretzels onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. If they are a little wet this is ok. Brush pretzels with melted butter and sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake at 450 for 12-16 minutes or until golden brown For cheese sauce it is best to have all ingredients prepped and ready- measure milk and mustard, shred cheese, melt butter and whisk in flour. Bring milk to a slow boil on medium heat while whisking. Once boiling, reduce heat to low. slowly add flour/butter mixture while whisking. (You want the sauce as thick as a nacho cheese) Add cheese and whisk until fully melted Add hot mustard and whisk Viola!

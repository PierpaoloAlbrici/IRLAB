H2o Shake


Ingredients


 - 14 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 12 cup of ice creams, vanilla


 - 1 tablespoon of ice creams, vanilla


Instructions: 

Take an ice cream flavor of your preference and leave it to melt in a glass. Add your water on top. Now add the flavor that matches the ice cream flavor you choose. I would go with 1 tablespoons but if you like it stronger then add more. You can either blend it all or mix it by hand. Drink up. I am not sure yet if 1 tablespoons of vanilla is adequate but I imagine you could go with caramel ice cream topping as a substitute. But on that note I imagine jellies or other toppings would be great to mix in with vanilla ice cream as well. There's a while word of flavor, so try things until you like them.

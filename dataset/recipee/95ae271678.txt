Basic Low Carb Pie Crust Recipe


Ingredients


 - 3/4 cup of beverages, protein powder whey based


 - 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/4 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 1/2 cup of lard


 - 1 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Mix together whey protein pwdr (or possibly soy flour), oat flour, and almond flour. Cut shortening or possibly lard into flour mix with two knives or possibly a pastry blender, using a "cutting" motion. It will resemble peas when done. Add in water, 1 Tbsp. at a time till dough can hold together. Chill until chilled for easier handling. This dough can be rolled out by putting between two pcs of waxed paper, or possibly you can put the dough in a 9-inch pie plate and pat it up the sides to the rim. Spray Pam on a pie plate (glass/Pyrex works best) before putting crust in. Oil your hands to make it easier to manage dough if you are using the patting method. If you take the pie crust over the rim, be sure to put aluminum foil or possibly pastry rim-guards around edges to prevent it browing too much before pie filling is done. Pour filling into crust and bake per directions. If you need a completely baked crust (for cream fillings or possibly no-bake cheesecake etc. ), pierce crust with a fork and bake at 350 degrees for 5 - 10 min. Watch it closely to prevent burning! This recipe yields 1 crust; entire crust has 30 grams carbs made with whey pwdr or possibly 37 grams carbs made with soy flour. Note 1: Keep in mind whey protein pwdr is 2 grams of carbs or possibly less (many are zero carb) and shouldn't be confused with "sweet whey" found in many health food stores (it's very high carb.) Note 2: To add in flavor to the regular pie crust recipe, add in any ONE of the following (and if your filling is a sweet one, a Tbsp. of Splenda can be nice as well): o 2 tsp. lemon peelo 1 tsp. orange peelo 2 Tbsp. baking cocoao 2 tsp. cinammono 1/4 tsp. nutmego 1 tsp. instant coffee to water Yield: 1 crust

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1/8 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

 - 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

### Instructions

All of these recipes come from _Maida Heatter's Book of Great Chocolate Deserts_, that I highly recommend to any and all of you chocolate fiends on the Porch. 1. Break up chocolate and place in the top half of a large double boiler (1 - 1 1/2 quart). Heat over warm-not boiling- water till chocolate is melted. Stir in sugar, salt and butter; then gradually add in the cream, stirring till smooth. 2. Put the top half of the double boiler over direct heat (low-medium) and stir constantly for 4 - 5 min till the sauce thickens slightly. Don't boil! 3. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Serve hot or possibly at room temperature.

Pimiento Cheese Spread


Ingredients


 - 27 ounce of spices, pepper, black


 - 30 ounce of cheese, cheddar


 - 1 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular


Instructions: 

Place the drained pimientos in a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. Using an electric mixer, combine the cheese and pimiento, beating until smooth. Beat in the mayonnaise. Spread on slices of white sandwich bread while the mixture is room temperature. Trim the bread crusts and cut the sandwiches into triangles. The spread may be stored, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Remove the spread from the refrigerator and allow it to reach room temperature before serving. Make a lot of these. One triangle disappears in only three bites!

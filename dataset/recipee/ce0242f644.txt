Homemade English Muffins


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 tablespoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1/2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 3 1/4 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

Add 1/4 cup warm water and yeast to a medium bowl, cover with a towel and let it sit for 5 minutes. Then, add remaining water, milk and sugar. Cover with the towel and let it sit for five more minutes. Sift flour and salt into a stand mixer bowl. Using the bread hook combine the flour and the yeast mixture at a medium speed. Let the mixer knead the dough for about 7-8 minutes or until dough comes together. Place dough in a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap and a towel. Let the dough rise for 3-4 hours. After the dough has risen, punch it down and work it onto a floured surface. Split it into 8-10 equal-sized dough balls. Roll each ball between your hands to form a round ball of dough. Place dough balls on a cookie sheet. Cover with a towel and let them rise for 25-30 minutes. Preheat oven to 325 F. Heat a portion of the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Drop 2-3 dough balls onto the skillet, flatten them a bit and let the dough cook for 5-7 minutes until a golden crust develops. Then flip and cook the other side until it turns golden. Place the cooked muffins on a cookie sheet and repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. When done, bake for 10 minutes to ensure the insides are no longer doughy. Store in an airtight container in the fridge or freeze for later use.

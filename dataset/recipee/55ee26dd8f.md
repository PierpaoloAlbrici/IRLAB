### Ingredients

 - 1 1/2 pound of pork, fresh, loin, tenderloin, separable lean only, raw

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 teaspoon of lime juice, raw

### Instructions

Cut into 1-inch cubes: 1 1/2 pounds boneless pork shoulder. Place the meat in a wide heavy-bottomed pan in a single layer. Add water to just cover the meat. Stir in: 1/2 teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons fresh lime juice. Bring to a simmer, cover the pan, and cook gently until tender, about 45 minutes. Take off the lid, turn up the heat, and allow the liquid to boil away. When the meat begins to sizzle, turn down the heat, and fry gently until golden. Remove the meat from the pan and allow the excess fat to drain off. Taste for salt and add more if needed.

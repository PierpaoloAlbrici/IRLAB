Greek Yogurt


Ingredients


 - 1 gallon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


Instructions: 

In a pan, bring milk to almost boiling. Pour in to a non-metallic bowl. Cover and allow to cool to between 110-120F. Gently mix in the yogurt. Cover bowl top and bottom with towels to retain warmth as the yogurt sets-- 8 to 12 hours or overnight. Do not disturb it until the yogurt thickens. Drain any excess liquid and store in the fridge for 4 to 5 days. If you want a thicker yogurt, hang in a muslin bag or cheesecloth for several hours to drain. You will lose a lot of volume in any additional dripping.

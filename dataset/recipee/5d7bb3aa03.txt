Taco Seasoned Pretzels


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of oil, canola


 - 3 teaspoon of seasoning mix, dry, taco, original


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 4 cup of pretzels, soft, unsalted


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 200 degrees F. Lightly spray a 10x15x1 jelly roll pan with nonstick cooking spray. Spread the pretzels in an even layer on the jelly roll pan. In a small bowl, mix the canola oil, taco seasoning, and garlic powder together until blended. Pour evenly over the pretzels and stir until all of the pretzels are evenly coated. I found that it was easiest to mix them with my hands. Bake in the preheated oven for 60-75 minutes, stirring every 15-20 minutes. Allow them to sit at room temperature to harden for about 15 minutes before serving. Notes: This is barely a recipe. With that being said, make it your own! Use fajita seasoning, grilling seasoning, poultry seasoning, Greek seasoningyou get the point. Its so versatile and the pretzels will be fabulous with whatever seasoning you decide to add! Next time I will try adding some Chex cereal or peanuts for some different texture.

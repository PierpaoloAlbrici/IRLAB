### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of lentils, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, onion powder

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 2 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

 - 1 pinch of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

### Instructions

Soak 1/2 cup lentils 8 to 12 hours, drain. Sprout 3-5 days. Rinse 2 times daily, grow until the length of shoots equals the seed length. Place sprouts in a bowl and mix in 2 tbs onion powder, 1 teaspoons garlic powder, 2 tbs tamari soy sauce and a pinch of cayenne pepper (if desired). Spread out thinly on a baking tray, and bake at 250F until brittle and crispy, which takes about 1 hour. Alternatively, the snack sprouts can be dried in a food dehydrator. When the sprouts have dried out, store in a container with a lid, which will keep them dry and crisp. Enjoy!

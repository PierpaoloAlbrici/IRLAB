Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. In a large mixing bowl, sift whole wheat flour, bread flour, salt and baking powder. Sift three more times. Mix in 1/4 cup oil. In a separate bowl, dissolve honey in water. Stir into flour mixture. Mix just until a sticky dough pulls together.

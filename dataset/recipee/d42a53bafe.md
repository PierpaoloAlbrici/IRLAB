 - 5 tablespoon of nuts, pistachio nuts, raw

 - 1 1/4 cup of figs, dried, uncooked

Remove 8 whole pistachios, halve them and set aside for garnishing. Finely chop 2 tablespoons of remaining pistachios in food processor. Now remove from container and set aside. Combine remaining pistachios, figs and grated orange peel in processor; process until mixture forms into ball, a little under 1 minute. Shape into an 8" log, then roll in reserved chopped nuts. Chill until firm, and cut into 16 slices. Place halved pistachios in center of each.

Taiwanese Daikon Radish Cakes


Ingredients


 - 200 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 110 g of water, bottled, generic


 - 240 g of radishes, raw


 - 60 g of crustaceans, shrimp, raw (not previously frozen)


 - 1 tablespoon of onions, spring or scallions (includes tops and bulb), raw


 - 2 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 1 dash of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, sesame, salad or cooking


 - 1 dash of salt, table


Instructions: 

Finely julienne the daikon radish, work the salt into it, and let sit for 5 minutes. Soak the dried shrimp in water. Combine the daikon radish, shrimp, minced scallions, and the seasonings. Mix the flour and hot water together with chopsticks. Once cool, knead a bit, cover with paper towels, and let rest. Divide into 10 equal balls. Press each ball flat. Roll with a rolling pin until about 10 cm in diameter. Top the dough with the mixed filling. Wrap up them into buns. This recipe yields 10 buns. Heat some oil (amount separate from listed ingredients) in a pan and arrange the buns inside. Be sure to slowly cook them over low heat. Flip them over to cook the other side. And they're done!

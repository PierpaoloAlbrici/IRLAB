Candied kumquats


Ingredients


 - 300 g of kumquats, raw


 - 150 g of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Wash thoroughly. Make about 6 cuts into the kumquats with the top part still attached. Take out the seeds, using a bamboo skewer, while pressing the tops and bottoms. Soak the kumquats in a pot filled with plenty of water. Boil for 2-3 minutes, and drain. With the kumquats in the pot, fill just enough water to cover, and simmer over low heat until soft. Slowly add the sugar in 2-3 portions, and cook for about 30-40 minutes.

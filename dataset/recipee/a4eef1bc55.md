### Ingredients

 - 3 tablespoon of corn, sweet, white, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of corn, sweet, white, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1 tablespoon of onions, raw

### Instructions

In a spice grinder or Magic Bullet, ground the black peppercorns first until it reaches the consistency of a course grind (shaking the bullet around so that it remains a consistent grind -- try not to make it too fine). Add the white peppercorns, garlic flakes and onion flakes and grind. Note: I leave my pepper in a medium grind -- removing (or crushing) any whole pepper that did not get incorporated.

### Ingredients

 - 90 g of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 90 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched

 - 150 g of butter, salted

 - 75 ml of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Sift together the bread flour and cake flour. Cut the butter into 2 cm cubes and keep chilled. Add butter to the sifted flour, and using a dough scraper, cut the butter while mixing into the flour, until the butter forms bean-sized lumps. Add chilled water to the dough from Step 2, mix with a spatula, then use your hands to bring it together. The key is not to knead it, leaving the dots of butter intact. Form the dough into a 10 cm x 15 cm rectangle, wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour or more in the refrigerator. When baking pies, it's easier if you prepare the dough a day in advance. Dust your working surface with flour, then roll out the dough to 1 cm thick, then fold into thirds, bringing the sides into the center. Rotate the dough 90 degrees , then repeat Step 5, 5 times--making a total of six repeated rolling steps. Now, it's ready to use! The once crumbly dough is now nice and smooth. To make puff pastry If you roll out the dough to 5 mm thick, then freeze them, you'll have a nice stock of puff pastry! For apple pies, bake for a total of 40 minutes: 20 minutes at 200C, then for 20 more minutes at 180C. See my Heart Shaped Sugar Pie.

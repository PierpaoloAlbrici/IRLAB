Yummy Baked Taters or Wedges


Ingredients


 - 1 kg of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cumin seed


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, paprika


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 4 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 220C or 200C if fan forced. If using baby potatoes, wash and dry them and then cut into quarters. If using larger potatoes cut into rouughly 1 inch pieces. I like to place the potatoes into a large plastic bag, or you can add them to a large mixing bowl. The plastic bag is the easiest and least messy option. Add in the remaining ingredients and ensure thoroughly mixed. Pour the potatoes out onto a flat tray in a single layer. I like to use cookies sheets. You dont need to grease the trays as the potatoes are already coated. Place in the oven and turn after 20 minutes. Cook until done to your liking. Mine usually take 40 to 50 minutes.

Vegan Banana Nut Breakfast Cake


Ingredients


 - 2 tablespoon of seeds, chia seeds, dried


 - 6 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1/2 cup of applesauce, canned, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid (includes usda commodity)


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 cup of bananas, raw


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, pecans


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Liberally spray an 8x8 baking dish. Set aside. Combine the chia seeds and warm water in a small bowl and set aside. The mixture will gel and will be used in place of eggs in the batter. In a small bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt together until combined. In a large bowl, whisk the oil and sugar until combined. Add the chia/water mixture, applesauce, vanilla and bananas. Mix well. Slowly add the flour mixture, stirring to combine all dry ingredients Fold in the pecans and pour into prepared pan. Bake for 40-50 minutes until a toothpick inserted comes out cleanly. Serve warm or at room temperature. Notes: If you prefer to make this not vegan, you can replace the chia/egg mixture with 2 eggs and replace the applesauce with the same amount of melted butter. Other substitutions: substitute all-purpose flour for whole-wheat; omit pecans altogether or replace with walnuts or almonds; use canola instead of grapeseed oil. I served the cake with peanut butter and honey. It would also be wonderful with Biscoff spread, fresh bananas and yogurt.

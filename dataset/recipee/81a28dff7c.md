### Ingredients

 - 5 pound of apples, raw, with skin

 - 2 cup of apple juice, canned or bottled, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid

 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground

 - 18 teaspoon of spices, cloves, ground

 - 1/2 cup of syrup, maple, canadian

### Instructions

In a large saucepan add apples and apple cider. Bring to a light boil, cover and simmer until apples are softened, approximately 20 minutes. Stir occasionally. With an immersion hand blender, process apples until creamy and smooth. If you dont have a immersion blender, process in batches in your food processor or blender. Then put the apples back into the pot. Over low heat add lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and maple syrup. Stir until well incorporated. Cook uncovered for approximately 1 1/2 hours until thick and darkened, stirring every 5 to 10 minutes or so. Be careful not to burn the apple butter. Remove from heat. Let apple butter cool to room temperature. As it cools it will thicken more. Place in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 weeks.

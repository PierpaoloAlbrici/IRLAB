Broiled Brussels Sprouts


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of brussels sprouts, raw


 - 3 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Choose sprouts that are heavy with moisture. Avoid those that feel light. They could be old and dried out. Wash sprouts with vegetable/produce wash to remove any viruses, bacteria or harmful pesticides. Rinse sprouts and drain in colander. Cut off base/stem of each sprout. Do not waste too much. Compost the stems. Cut each sprout into quarters. Place in an iron skillet or another oven safe skillet. Drizzle with olive oil. You may use more or less as per your taste or health needs. Add some grey sea salt. The grey has more trace minerals and is healthier. I like the extra fine velvet style. Its wet so it takes some shaking to get it out. Use only what you feel comfortable with, especially if you have blood pressure issues. Place skillet under broiler flame at high for 3 to 5 minutes. I have a broiler separate from my oven. If you only have the oven, you wont get the exact same effect. Try putting them up high if the element is at the top of your oven. SET A TIMER!! These babies can scorch. Use tongs to grab and toss well. Set under the broiler flame again and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes depending on strength/heat of your broiler. Toss again. The outer leaves should be browning. They can go to a nice dark brown. Do not let them blacken. Some prefer a medium brown color. Just keep checking on them. And tossing. Repeat the broiling and tossing process to cook all sides evenly, distribute oil/salt and get lots of browning. The broiling and salt removes that horrid, bitter taste. Use caution: sprout haters like me will become addicts instantly. Thanks go to Suzanne Skinas who taught me to make these. They have a nice toasty flavor that actually brings out the few sugar molecules that must be in there somewhere! I like them toasty and very crispy. The outer leaves will flake off and create a nicely textured and colored dish. Serve hot out of the skillet to the plates. A toaster oven is also perfect for this if you have no broiler. The hot element will toast them nicely. But, make sure to toss them often! Just watch them. The burn sneaks up on you. You think since they are a green veggie you can turn your back. But you cant. This is one way I can eat a super food, i.e., anti-cancer, I used to detest. Buon appetito!

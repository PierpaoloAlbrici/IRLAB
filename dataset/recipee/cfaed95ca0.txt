Cheddar Drop Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 14 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 18 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 23 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 1 pinch of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 12 cup of cheese, cheddar


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. In a midium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cayenne, and salt. Whisk gently to blend. With a pastry blender or two knives, cut in the butter and Cheddar cheese until the mixture resembles coarse meal. (Or pulse in a food processor.) Add the buttermilk and stir until just blended; do not overmix. Drop by heaping tablespoons about 2 inches apart onto a lightly greased cookie sheet. Bake about 12 minutes, until the biscuits are golden brown.

Gingerbread Popcorn


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)


 - 1 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, cloves, ground


 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of sugars, brown


 - 2 tablespoon of molasses


 - 1 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Toss together the popped popcorn and nuts in a large bowl and set aside. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a Silpat liner and set aside. Sift together the baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves in a small bowl and set aside. Cook the butter, sugar, molasses, water, and salt in a medium-sized, thick-bottomed saucepan over medium heat until the temperature reaches 305 degrees F (hard crack stage), stirring occasionally. Then remove from heat. Carefully stir in the vanilla and baking soda/spice mix and then pour it over the popcorn/nut mixture. Use 2 heat-safe rubber spatulas to toss the popcorn around to distribute the toffee throughout. Spread out the popcorn onto the prepared baking sheet. Let it cool and then break it apart. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.

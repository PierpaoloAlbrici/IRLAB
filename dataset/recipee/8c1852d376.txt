Low Fat Pie Crust - Crunchy Nutty Pie Crust


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt


 - 1/4 cup of wheat germ, crude


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 3 tablespoon of egg substitute, powder


Instructions: 

Place the cereal, wheat germ or nuts, and brown sugar in a small bowl, and stir to mix well. Stir in the egg substitute. Coat a 9-in. pie pan with nonstick cooking spray. Use the back of a spoon to pat the mixture against the bottom and sides of the pan, forming an even crust. Bake at 350 degrees (175 C.) for about 12 minutes, or until the edges feel firm and dry. Cool the crust to room temperature and fill with a precooked filling, or fill and bake as directed in the recipe.

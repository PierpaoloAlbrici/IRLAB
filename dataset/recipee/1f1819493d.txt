Cereal Killer Bars


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 12 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 12 cup of syrups, corn, light


 - 4 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

In a saucepan mix together the margarine, white sugar, peanut butter and corn syrup. Heat to boiling and boil for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and add the Rice Krispies. Mix and pat into an 8" square buttered dish. Top with chocolate chips while still warm and smear the chips as they melt, to cover the squares. (Sometimes I will use a hairdryer to speed along the melting process). Score these squares with a knife while they are still warm, but do not cut until they are set. ENJOY!

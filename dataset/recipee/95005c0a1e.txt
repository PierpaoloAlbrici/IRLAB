Best Flour Tortillas


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 2 tablespoon of lard


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Mix together the flour, salt and baking powder in a large bowl. Add the lard and mix by hand until the flour resembles cornmeal. Pour in the hot water a little bit at a time and mix until the dough comes together. Place it on a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, approximately 3-5 minutes. Heat a nonstick skillet or griddle pan over medium-high heat. Break off equal-sized pieces, roll into a ball and roll into a thin, round tortilla shape. Make sure your rolling pin is well floured. Place on the hot skillet, cook until bubbly, flip and repeat twice. Wrap cooked tortillas with a towel or put in a tortilla warmer. Makes approximately 24 tortillas.

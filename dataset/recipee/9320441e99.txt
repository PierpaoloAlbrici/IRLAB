Vickys Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies, Gluten, Dairy, Egg & Soy-Free


Ingredients


 - 350 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of xanthan gum, upc: 071518021764


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 250 ml of sweetener, syrup, agave


 - 6 tablespoon of applesauce, canned, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid (includes usda commodity)


 - 225 ml of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 150 g of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to gas 3 / 170C / 325F and line baking sheets with parchment paper Combine the flour, baking soda, xanthan gum and salt in a bowl In a larger bowl beat together the cane juice, applesauce, oil and vanilla until smooth. Add the flour & chocolate chips and combine. The dough should be like a stiff cake mix more than a dough Drop tablespoons of the mix onto the baking sheets and flatten with the back of a wet spoon (these don't spread out a lot). I do them in batches of 18 Bake for 15 minutes then turn the trays around and bake a further 10 minutes or until just golden brown and soft but crisp around the edges. Let them stand on the tray for 10 minutes then place them on a wire rack to cool completely. Store in air-tight container

### Ingredients

 - 4 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 3/4 cup of shortening, vegetable, household, composite

 - 2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

Heat the oven to 375F. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Cut in the lard until the mixture resembles coarse-cut oatmeal. Make a well in the center and add the milk. Toss with your hands and knead to form a stiff dough. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough until it is 1/8 inch thick. Cut into squares or whatever shape you desire. I like 1-inch squares or scalloped rounds. Prick the dough with the tines of a fork, brush lightly with water, and sprinkle with salt. Transfer to a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes or until toasty and browned around the edges. Let cool before serving. Add spices, seeds, or flavored salts to the top of these crackers as desired before baking. A funny colloquialism for someone not looking so good is She looks like death eating a soda cracker. I dont know where it came from, but the women in my family have thrown it around for generations.

The Get Over It Already, Sweet Potato Caserole


Ingredients


 - 15 ounce of pineapple, raw, all varieties


 - 4 cup of sweet potato, raw, unprepared


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 2 teaspoon of pumpkin, raw


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. For the sweet potatoes: Drain pineapple reserving the juice. Set the pineapple aside. Mix the juice with the mashed sweet potatoes, granulated sugar, melted butter,vanilla, 1 teaspoon of the pumpkin pie spice and the Saigon cinnamon. Pour into lightly greased 2 quart baking dish. Top with crushed pineapple. For the glaze: Mix the brown sugar, 1/2 cup butter, and the remaining teaspoon of the pumpkin pie spice in a small saucepan. Cook and stir over medium heat, just until sugar dissolves then add in pecans or walnuts. Spoon over sweet potato and pineapple mixture and sprinkle lightly with about 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg. Bake 35-45 minutes until lightly browned and heated through. To save time you can make this a few days in advance, and freeze it. Just pull it from the freezer to thaw about 2 hours before cooking . (I use an aluminum foil baking pan.)

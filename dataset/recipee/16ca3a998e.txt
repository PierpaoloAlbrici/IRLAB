Ingredients


 - 2 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 3/4 cup of butter, without salt

Whisk flour and salt together in a mixing bowl. Cut the cold butter and then the shortening into the flour mixture with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle vodka and water over the top of the mixture. Fold together ingredients until mixture sticks together to form a tacky dough. Divide dough into 2 halves; flatten each half into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate 1 hour to 2 days. When you are ready to make your pie, remove dough from refrigerator, roll each piece out for your pie from the middle to the edge. Bake according to your pie directions.

Multifunctional Rich Milky Cream


Ingredients


 - 150 ml of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 25 g of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 25 g of milk, canned, condensed, sweetened


 - 1 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Combine white chocolate and condensed milk to a bowl and set aside. In a pot, add heavy cream and skim milk and mix while heating, melt but don't quite bring to a boil. Add the heated fresh cream to the bowl with the white chocolate and condensed milk. Mix with a whisk while melting the chocolate. Once the chocolate has melted, submerge the bowl in ice water and mix in a circular motion without whipping. Once it's cooled, store in the refrigerator overnight. Before using it, mix in a circular motion using a whisk. Use once peaks form. If you whip too much it'll get stiff, so be careful!

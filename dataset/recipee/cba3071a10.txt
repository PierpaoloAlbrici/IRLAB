Pancake Mix Easy Steamed Buns


Ingredients


 - 200 g of pancakes, plain, dry mix, complete (includes buttermilk)


 - 170 ml of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Add the milk to the pancake mix and mix. As long and the flour and milk blend together it's fine. Don't overmix. Pour the batter into the aluminium foil cups about 70% full. Pour 5 mm - 1 cm of water in a frying pan, and arrange the foil cups in the pan. Cover with a lid, and start heating the frying pan on high heat. When the water comes to a boil, turn the heat down to low and steam for 10 to 12 minutes. Done. Be careful not to let the condensation fall on the bread when you remove the lid off. This is a cocoa version. I added 1-2 tablespoon of cocoa powder, 1 tablespoon sugar and a little vegetable oil (optional) to the basic batter, and steamed the same way. The bread looks like this when it's cut open. So fluffy and light! Add 1 tablespoon condensed milk and 1 tablespoon skim milk powder, and use 160 ml of water instead of milk. The cocoa version above is topped with chocolate chips, and made in mini muffin cups. Chocolate and cocoa do go well together. We've really been in to raisin steamed bread recently in our family. Just mix some raisins into the basic batter. This time the raisins sunk to the bottom. When I divided the dough into 7, water often got into the cups while cooking, so I tried making 8 instead and this worked a lot better. So I recommend making 8 at a time.

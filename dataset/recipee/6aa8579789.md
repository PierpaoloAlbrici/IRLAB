 - 1 cup of beans, snap, green, raw

### Instructions

Cook haricots vert or string beans in boiling, salted water until crisp tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and run under cold water to stop cooking. Cut into 1 1/2 inch - 2 inch pieces, if desired; set aside. Combine the red radish, red onion, and red pepper (hey, all the red stuff!) and sprinkle with the salt. Stir to combine. Strain for 30 minutes over a. bowl or into the sink (liquid is discarded). After the 30 minutes, rinse under cold water and shake the strainer a few times to lose some of that water. Let drain another 5 minutes or so. Meanwhile, heat cider vinegar and sugar in a small saucepan, over medium heat just until sugar is dissolved. Add oil and stir; set aside. In a large bowl, combine garbanzo beans, zucchini, and drained and strained vegetables. Pour vinegar mixture over and mix. Cover and refrigerate overnight. In the morning stir and recover. It will be ready by lunchtime!

Momma's Quickie Cocktail


Ingredients


 - 8 ounce of orange juice, raw


 - 1 1/2 ounce of alcoholic beverage, distilled, vodka, 80 proof


Instructions: 

Fill a tall glass with ice. Pour ingredients into glass. Stir to combine. Enjoy. Repeat as needed. Note: I find blood orange italian soda (with real juice) at Central Market. If you do not have access to this flavor, any other fruit flavored Italian Soda will work.

Instructions: 

This recipe requires a process called double-strength brewing for maximum flavor. Brew 12 tablespoons of coffee with only 6 cups of filtered water. This will be a very strong brew of coffee that needs to be set aside and chilled in your refrigerator for at least 3 hours. Blend coffee, milk, chocolate syrup and vanilla together in a blender with 2 cups of ice for at least 30 seconds or to desired thickness. Serve in tall glass. Top with whipped cream and a single mint leaf.

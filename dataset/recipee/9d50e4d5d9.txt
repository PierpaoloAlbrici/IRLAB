Dukkah


Ingredients


 - 4 tablespoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, coriander seed


 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of spices, cumin seed


 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of corn, sweet, white, raw


 - 12 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 18 cup of nuts, hazelnuts or filberts


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


Instructions: 

Heat a small, heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat and add the sesame seeds. Shake gently until they turn a shade darker and give out a nutty smell. Tip them into a bowl. Repeat this process with the coriander and cumin seeds. Allow them cool and crisp up for a few minutes. Place the sesame seeds, coriander, cumin, peppercorns and salt in a clean coffee or spice grinder and grind finely. Finely chop the hazelnuts in the grinder, taking care not to over-blend them into a paste. Mix the finely chopped hazelnuts with the sesame seed mixture and the cinnamon. Store in an airtight container until needed.

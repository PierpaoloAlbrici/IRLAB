Garden Hot Sauce


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 pound of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 cup of salt, table


 - 3 cup of vinegar, distilled


Instructions: 

Rinse peppers, remove stems, and chop coarsely. Wear latex gloves or coat your hands with oil before handling (and if you value your eyes, wash your hands multiple times before changing your contact lenses). Combine in a large bowl with the salt, cover, and let sit for 2 days, stirring about every 12 hours. Add vinegar and puree; place mixture in a sterilized 1 quart glass jar and refrigerate. As you use peppers, continue to chop them and add to the jar. When the jar is filled, remove and puree the sauce, place in a clean jar, and age for at least 2 months or until it reaches the desired flavor.

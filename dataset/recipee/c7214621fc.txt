Homemade Granola


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of oats


 - 1 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 3 tablespoon of seeds, flaxseed


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1/4 cup of oil, canola


 - 1/4 cup of honey


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

In a large bowl combine oats, coconut, almonds and flax seed; set aside. In a saucepan combine brown sugar (I use a heaping 1/4 cup), oil (also a heaping 1/4 cup), honey (heap here too) and cinnamon, bring to a boil. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Pour sauce over oat mixture and stir until completely coated. Pour granola onto a greased cookie sheet and bake at 325F for 12-15 minutes. Cool and store in an airtight container or Ziploc bag. I like to eat this with vanilla yogurt and frozen blueberries. Enjoy!

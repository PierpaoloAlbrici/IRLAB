### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 cup of lemon juice, raw

 - 1/2 cup of spices, basil, dried

 - 6 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Put sugar and water in saucepan. Heat up but dont let it boil, just enough to let sugar dissolve and until the liquid turns clear. Remove from heat and let cool. Add lemon juice and basil to a blender and process one minute. Pour sugar syrup and lemon mixture into a large glass pitcher (you can strain through a sieve first if you desire) and add water. Mix well with a wooden spoon. Garnish with additional lemon slices and basil if desired. Makes 8 servings.

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of nuts, pecans

 - 34 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

### Instructions

To make the cookies, in a large bowl, cream the butter and 1/3 cup confectioners' sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla. In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, pecans, 1/2 cup ground chocolate, cinnamon, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture and mix until well blended. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill for 1 to 2 hours, until firm. Preheat the oven to 325F Shape the dough into 1-inch balls. Place the balls 1 inch apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes, until the cookies are firm to the touch. Cool for 1 minute on the cookie sheet, and then transfer to a wire rack. Cool completely. To make the coating, sift the remaining confectioners' sugar (1 tablespoon) and 1/4 cup ground chocolate into a shallow bowl. Once the cookies are cool, roll them in the coating. Refrigerate airtight with waxed paper between layers up to 1 month.

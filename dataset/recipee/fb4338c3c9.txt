Summer Fresh Sesame Broccoli from Martha Stewart


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of broccoli, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 2 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 450*. Spread florets on baking sheet, drizzle oil over and toss to spread evenly. Roast for 20 minutes (browned). Toss broccoli with remaining ingredients. HOW TO TOAST SESAME SEEDS: place seeds in a metal pie plate, placed in oven with broccoli OR toast in a frying pan on the stove top. Watch carefully as they can burn mighty quick and don't taste a bit good like that! ALTERNATIVES: Toast some slivered almonds with the sesame seeds and add 2-3 T. with the seeds. Yumm-a-licious!

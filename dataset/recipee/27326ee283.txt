Streusel Topping


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

In a medium bowl, mix the flour, sugar, and salt. Using your fingers, work in the butter until large, moist crumbs form. (Make sure the crumbs are large so they form a crisp topping as the cake bakes instead of melting into the batter.) Chill streusel until ready to use.

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 1/2 cup of oats

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. In a large bowl, whisk together the flours, baking soda, oats and salt. Pour in most of the buttermilk and mix well, adding more buttermilk, if needed, to form a soft dough. Turn out onto a floured surface and lightly knead into a shapeable dough. Avoid overworking the dough. Shape the dough into a round disk shaped loaf and cut a deep "X" in the top with a sharp knife. Put the dough on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 7 minutes at 425 degrees F. Lower the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and bake another 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the bread from the oven to a cutting board. Cool slightly before cutting and enjoy warm!

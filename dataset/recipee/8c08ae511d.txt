Seed Jumble Cookies


Ingredients


 - 1/3 cup of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 1/3 cup of sweetener, syrup, agave


 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 2 tablespoon of nuts, almonds


 - 1/3 cup of seeds, sesame butter, tahini, from roasted and toasted kernels (most common type)


 - 1 1/4 cup of oats


 - 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/4 cup of seeds, flaxseed


 - 1/2 cup of seeds, sunflower seed kernels, dried


 - 1/2 cup of seeds, pumpkin and squash seeds, whole, roasted, without salt


 - 1/2 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 1/3 cup of cranberries, dried, sweetened


 - 1/3 cup of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350F (180C). Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper, or spray with nonstick spray. In a small bowl, whisk together the maple syrup, agave nectar, vanilla, almond butter and tahini until smooth. In a medium bowl, stir together the remaining ingredients. Pour the wet mixture over the dry and stir to combine well. The mixture will appear a bit crumbly and you may wonder if it will stick together enough; this is as it should be. Using a small ice cream scoop or tablespoon (15 cm), drop mounds of the mixture about 2 inches (5 cm) apart on cookie sheets (you may need to press the edges a bit for it to hold together). Bake for 10-15 minutes, rotating sheets about halfway through, until golden. Allow to cool completely before removing from the sheets (cookies will firm up as they cool). May be frozen.

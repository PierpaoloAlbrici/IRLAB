### Ingredients

 - 13 cup of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)

 - 1 1/2 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 13 cup of candies, white chocolate

### Instructions

Place the candy canes in a plastic bag, close bag and whack with a rolling pin to crush. Pop the popcorn kernels using your desired method. Allow popcorn to cool. Melt white chocolate melting wafers according to package directions. If you substitute white chocolate chips you need to add a tablespoon of butter once melted to soften the chocolate when it hardens, this will also make it smoother and easier to work with. Add the melted chocolate wafers to the popcorn and stir until fully coated. Slowly add crushed candy canes and stir into popcorn. Pour the covered popcorn on a sheet pan covered with wax paper and allow it to cool and harden. Once the mixture is cool break into bite sized pieces by hand. Store it in a cool airtight container.

Fish Fillets Valenciennes


Ingredients


 - 2 tablespoon of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


 - 13 cup of onions, raw


 - 2 cup of mushrooms, white, raw


 - 2 pound of fish, tilapia, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of parsley, fresh


 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, oregano, dried


 - 18 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

In a wide skillet with lid cook the onion and mushrooms over medium heat in the margarine for about five minutes, stirring often. Reduce heat to low and place the fish fillets over the mushrooms in a single layer. Sprinkle the remaining ingredients over the fish. Cover the skillet and simmer gently for about 20 minutes (25 minutes if the fillets were frozen). Carefully transfer the fillets to a platter. If the sauce is watery, boil down rapidly. Otherwise, pour the mushrooms, onions, and juices over the fish and serve.

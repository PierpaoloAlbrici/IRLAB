### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of potatoes, raw, skin

 - 4 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 3 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 1/2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 1/2 cup of butter, without salt

 - 3 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2-3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

In a large saucepan or pot, bring the water to boil and add the milk, butter, sugar, and salt. When the milk has come to a boil, add the potato flakes and stir until smooth. Pour the potatoes into a large bowl and refrigerate. When ready to make the lefse, take out 2 cups of potatoes at a time and add 1 to 1 1/2 cups of flour and stir until it becomes a workable dough. Flour a counter surface and roll the dough out as thin as possible. Cut individual slices with the a round cookie cutter, or the top of a medium sized glass. Add about 1 tsp oil to a skillet pan and cook the lefse for about 3-5 minutes, or when brown blisters start to form on the top. Flip and cook for another 3-5 minutes. Continue to cook the individual slices until the potato dough is gone. You may be able to cook several lefse at a time if you have a large enough skillet, if not cook one at a time. Any leftover cooked lefse may be refrigerate and used for about 3-5 more days.

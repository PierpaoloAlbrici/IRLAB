Basic Pasta Dough


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of semolina, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Combine the above ingredients to make a dough. wrap in a towel and let sit for 30 minutes. [start the sauce heating.] After the 30 minutes, [start the water boiling] divide the dough in half and roll out each half, allowing the first sheet of pasta to sit while rolling out the second. When the sheets are dryish, cut according to how you like your pasta. The pasta maker recommends rolling, and folding in half before rerolling. after rolling you are supposed to sprinkle some flour betwixt the two halves. If you create a dry enough dough, then you do not need to do this. in fact, the first time through the rollers, my dough is pretty crumbly at the edges, but a few more passes makes the dough much more workable. Cook for about 2 minutes.

### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

Organize the Cutlets, Egg mixture, and crumbs in an assembly line fashion. Take one cutlet at a time and submerge it in the egg mixture completely, take it out and let the excess mixture drip off. Then lay the cutlet flat on each side one the Bread Crumbs, coating both sides of the cutlet entirely. (This process goes fast.) Place all the breaded cutlets on another plate as you go. After youre all done, the oil should be ready. Using a pair of cooking tongs, place the prepared cutlets in the oil to start frying them. The oil should be medium to high heat, not smoking hot. Do 2 or 3 cutlets at a time. Cook only 15 to 20 seconds on each side to prevent the Abalone from getting too tough. (This frying process fast too.) Serve to your family and friends immediately, they will Love you.

[89e29372fa](http://www.food.com/recipe/vinegar-and-honey-facial-toner-131186)

### Ingredients

 - 2-4 tablespoon of honey

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 12 cup of vinegar, cider

### Instructions

Mix all ingredients together until honey has completely disolved. Pour into a bottle and cap (I use the glass bottle that my Rose Water comes in - then cork it with a clean wine cork). You may choose to keep this toner in the fridge for a cool refreshing feel, or leave it at room temperature. Use a cotton ball to smooth over face and neck after washing. Allow to dry/Leave on. ***I recommend giving this mixture several days to 'rest' before actually using (shaking on occasion to keep sediments from forming). This will prevent a slightly 'sticky' feel on your skin from the honey. Give it a few good shakes to make sure the honey stays well blended before use.

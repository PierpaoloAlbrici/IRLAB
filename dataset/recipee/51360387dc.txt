Cooking.com Tip: Depending upon the barbecue sauce you use, this tangy sauce can only go from good to the sublime. Our favorites can be found in the BBQ Sauce Sampler by Two Buddies. The set includes three jars of award-winning sauces by this California company: Hickory Sweet BBQ Sauce, Fire-Roasted Teriyaki Glaze and Marinade for Santa Barbara Beef. We especially like the smoky sweetness of the Hickory Sweet BBQ Sauce - it makes this sauce delicious spread over grilled hamburgers or possibly chicken. Stir all ingredients in large bowl to blend. Cover and chill till ready to use. DO-AHEAD TIP: Sauce may be made 3 days ahead. Keep refrigerated. Yield: 1 1/2 c.

Classic Buttermilk Biscuits (Nytimes)


Ingredients


 - 1 tablespoon of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 5 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 10 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Set rack in upper third of oven and preheat to 500F. Sift together in bowl cream of tartar and baking soda to make baking powder. In a large bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the butter. Working quickly, rub it between your fingertips until half is coarsely blended and remaining pieces are 3/4" thick. Make a well in the center of the flour. Add all the buttermilk and stir mixture QUICKLY, just until it has blended and a sticky dough forms. (Add 1-2 tbsp.more buttermilk if dough appears too dry. ). Immediately turn the dough onto a floured surface. Using floured hands, briskly knead about 10 times until a ball forms. Gently flatten the dough, and using a flouring rolling pin, roll to 3/4" thick. Prick dough with flour dipped fork at 1/2 " intervals. Flour a 2-3" biscuit cutter and stamp out rounds. Arrange on a heavy, parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake only until golden--10-12 minutes. Remove and brush with the melted butter. Serve hot. NOTE: Great for breaksfast right out of the oven with butter and honey. We eat biscuit leftovers reheated and cracked in half with a creamed vegetable/chicken mixture. (Tastes like mini potpies).

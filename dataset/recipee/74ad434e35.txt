Chocolate Peanut Butter Squares


Ingredients


 - 7 ounce of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 4 ounce of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 14 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1 1/2 cup of sugars, powdered


 - 14 cup of butter, without salt


 - 34 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


Instructions: 

Grease a 9x9 pan. Set aside. Place the first three ingredients (the chocolates and 1 tablespoon of butter) into a microwave safe bowl and melt completely. Set aside. In a medium bowl, combine all the remaining ingredients to make the peanut butter base. Mix until smooth. The mixture will have a slightly "sandy" texture. Ignore any lumps in the brown sugar. Press mixture evenly into prepared pan. Spread the melted chocolate over all. Put the pan in the fridge to set. Cut into 48 pieces (best if you cut the pieces before the chocolate is completely hard).

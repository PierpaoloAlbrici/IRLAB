### Instructions

Blend well, cover and store. Black Magic seasoning is an essential part of Southern cuisine and my kitchen is never without it. This seasoning adds extra kick as 1 of the components of Marlowe's BBQ dry rub, but it is also fabulous by itself. Try spicing up your chicken or fish by adding a liberal amount of this seasoning before grilling or pan-frying.

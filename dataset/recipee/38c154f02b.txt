Date Triangles


Ingredients


 - 1 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of orange juice, raw


 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt


 - 2 teaspoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 3 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 3/4 cup of dates, deglet noor


 - 1/3 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 2 tablespoon of orange juice, raw


 - 1/2 teaspoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


Instructions: 

In a food processor, combine flour, sugar, salt, and half the zest; pulse to combine. Add butter; pulse until mixture is crumbly. Combine orange-flower water, if using, and ice water; drizzle over mixture. Pulse until dough just comes together. Chill, covered, for 20 minutes. In the clean bowl of a food processor, combine dates, almonds, remaining zest, and orange juice; pulse to coarsely chop. Heat oven to 350F. Form dough into 1 1/2-inch-diameter balls; flatten into 3 1/2-inch circles. Place 1 heaping teaspoon date filling on each. Fold sides toward centers, making triangles; press to flatten slightly. Place pastries 2 inches apart on baking sheets lined with parchment paper; press again. In a small bowl, whisk to combine milk and honey; brush on pastries. Arrange 3 sliced almonds on each pastry. Bake until golden, 30 to 40 minutes, rotating sheets halfway through. Transfer pastries to a wire rack; brush with glaze again. Let stand 15 minutes before serving. Cookies can be kept in an airtight container at room temperature up to 3 days.

### Ingredients

 - 250 g of margarine, regular, hard, soybean (hydrogenated)

 - 2 liter of water, bottled, generic

 - 130 g of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

Soak the soya beans in water overnight. Make sure that the water can always totally cover the beans. Whirl the beans with water in a blender little by little until a smooth mixture is obtained. Filter the mixture with muslin-made bag (or other fine cloth). Pour the mixture into a pot. Cook the mixture and add the sugar. Remove the foam floating on the surface whenever necessary. Take the pot away from heat when it has just boiled. You can enjoy the soya milk whether immediately or freeze it.

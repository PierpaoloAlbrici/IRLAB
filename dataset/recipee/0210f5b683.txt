Pecan Pie Brittle


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 1/2 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract


 - 14 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Heat sugar in a 4-qt. saucepan over medium-high heat; cook, swirling pan often, until golden amber and completely liquefied. Add pecans and butter and cook, stirring, until caramel is liquid again and butter is absorbed, about 2 minutes. Combine vanilla extract and baking soda in a bowl and then add to pan along with salt; stir to combine. Pour onto a baking sheet lined with foil or a silicone baking mat and spread into an even layer with a small rubber spatula; let cool completely. Break into bite-size pieces and store in an airtight container between sheets of wax paper.

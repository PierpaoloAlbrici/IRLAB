### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1/4 cup of oil, canola

 - 1/4 cup of cream, sour, cultured

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 tablespoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 2 tablespoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 2 cup of squash, summer, zucchini, includes skin, raw

 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease an 8 x 11 baking pan with cooking spray, set aside. In a stand mixer, combine sugar, canola oil, sour cream and flour. Mix this together until mixture resembles wet sand. While mixing, on low speed, add cocoa powders, zucchini, vanilla extract, salt and baking soda. Mix until well combined. I had to add a little milk to my batter because it was too dry. Stir in the chocolate chips. Pour brownie batter into the prepared pan and bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean and the brownies are set. Cool on a wire rack. Cut brownies into squares and serve.

### Ingredients

 - 14 cup of mushrooms, white, raw

 - 2 1/2 teaspoon of onions, raw

 - 2 1/2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 2 1/2 teaspoon of spices, thyme, dried

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, parsley, dried

 - 1 3/4 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

### Instructions

In a mixing bowl, combine the dried mushrooms, onion flakes, garlic powder, dried thyme, and parsley and mix well. Add the rice and toss, making sure all of the ingredients are evenly combined. Pour the rice into a jar and seal tightly. Makes enough for 6 servings. This homemade rice mix is easy to cook and versatile enough to complement just about any main dish. For 6 servings, combine 2 1/2 cups of water and rice mix in a medium saucepan and bring them to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork. Serve hot with salt and pepper to taste.

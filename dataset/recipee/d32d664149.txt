Macadamia-Coconut Crumb Topping


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/3 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 5 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1/4 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, macadamia nuts, raw


Instructions: 

In a large bowl, mix together the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Using a pastry blender, incorporate the butter by cutting it in to the flour until the buter forms small, pea-size pieces. Add the coconut and macadamia nuts, and mix with the pastry blender until all of the ingredients are well combined. Pair this topping with a traditional pastry pie shell and the filling of your choice. Once the filling has been placed in the pie shell, distribute the macadamia-coconut crumb topping evenly over the filling until it is completely covered. Bake as directed.

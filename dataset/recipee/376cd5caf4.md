### Ingredients

 - 3 tablespoon of sugars, brown

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, canola

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1/3 cup of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)

### Instructions

Combine the sugar, 1 tablespoon of the oil, the salt and pepper in a small bowl; set aside. Combine the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and the popcorn kernels in a large pot set over medium-high heat. Cover and shake the pan occasionally until the popping stops, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the popcorn to a bowl. Add the sugar mixture to the hot pot, reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring, until the mixture become nearly liquid, about 1 minute. Remove the pot from the heat, stir the popcorn back in, and toss until the popcorn is evenly coated, about 2 minutes, then serve.

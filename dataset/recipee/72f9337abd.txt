Apricot Couscous


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of couscous, dry


 - 1/2 cup of apricots, dried, sulfured, uncooked


 - 3 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

In a medium-size baking dish, stir together couscous and apricots. Mix boiling water and salt in a measuring cup. Pour over couscous, and immediately cover the dish with foil. Let stand until liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Remove foil, and fluff couscous with a fork. If you need to keep it warm, place couscous in a low oven until ready to serve.

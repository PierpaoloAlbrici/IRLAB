### Ingredients

 - 2 1/2 pound of tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average

### Instructions

Core tomatoes. Cut a slit in the skin of each. Place in a 2 1/2-quart souffle dish and cover tightly with microwave plastic wrap. Cook in a 650-to 700-watt oven at 100 percent power for 12 minutes. Prick plastic with the tip of a sharp knife to release steam. Remove from oven and uncover carefully. Pass tomatoes through the medium disc of a food mill. Return tomato puree to dish and cook, uncovered, at 100 percent power for 20 minutes, stirring once or twice, until puree is reduced by half. Remove from oven and use, or let cool to room temperature and refrigerate or freeze in 1-cup or 1/2-cup quantities in microwavable storage containers.

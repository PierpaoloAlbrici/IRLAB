Blackberry Jelly Like Grandma Made


Ingredients


 - 16 cup of blackberries, raw


 - 12-16 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 3 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Rinse berries and place in large kettle with water. Bring to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Drain berries and put threw cheesecloth to remove all seeds. Add back to kettle with sugar. Boil to 220 degrees (-2 degrees for each 1000 feet above sea level)- I just used 220 in Ohio. ?. I have noticed I need to boil at the 220 mark for awhile for a nice gel, so make sure you not only hit the 220 mark but go for 221, to be on the safe side. Put in sterilized jars.

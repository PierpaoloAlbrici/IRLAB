### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of peas, green, frozen, unprepared

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 23 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 2 cup of blueberries, raw

### Instructions

Soak the dried lentils overnight and rinse. Combine the lentils and salt in a high speed blender and blend, adding just enough water to form a thick swirling batter. Add the oil to a preheated fry pan or skillet. Blend in the baking powder just before pouring the batter into the fry pan. Pour out 5 inch (12cm) pancakes, spreading the thick batter with the back of a spoon. Fry pancakes over medium high heat (375 F) for about 5 minutes or until golden brown. Flip and fry the other side until golden brown. Measure two cups of fresh or frozen berries. Slice strawberries if using and heat frozen berries. Top each serving of pancakes with berries and enjoy! If your pancakes turn out with raw centres, cook them lower and slower. If cooking in batches keep cooked pancakes covered and warm in the oven.

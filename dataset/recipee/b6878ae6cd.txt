Easy Kitchenaid Mixer Pizza Dough


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 1/4 ounce of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, oregano, dried


 - 1 tablespoon of honey

Instructions: 

Put water in mixer bowl and sprinkle yeast over water to dissolve. Mix water and yeast with whisk attachment until foamy. Add Olive Oil, Salt, Oregano and Honey and whisk together until well blended. Add 1 Cup of Flour and mix together. Remove whisk attachment scraping dough mixture into bowl and attach bread hook to mixer. Add another Cup of Flour and mix on low speed until well incorporated and dough is not "sticky". If dough is too sticky, add the additonal 1/4 cup (or more) of flour until it resembles bread dough. Mix dough on medium speed for 5-7 minutes until it is elastic and smooth. Remove dough ball from mixer and place in an oiled bowl large enough for the dough to double in size.Cover bowl with a damp cloth and allow dough to rise in a warm place, away from drafts. When dough is doubled in size (15-20 minutes), remove from bowl and punch down dough, roll out to desired thickness and shape. Drizzle Olive Oil on rolled out dough, sprinkle with additonal Dried Oregano and Kosher Salt, and top as desired. Bake on a perforated pizza pan in a very hot (500 degree) oven. Start pizza on bottom rack for 5 minutes. Using a pizza peal, slide the peal underneath the pan and move the pizza to the oven's top rack. Continue baking until crust is browned, and toppings are heated (5-7 minutes more). Using the pizza peal, remove the pizza pan from the oven carefully. Place pan on a heat proof surface, then use the pizza peal to remove the pizza from the pan. Allow pizza to cool for 2 minutes on the peal, then slice as desired using a pizza cutter.

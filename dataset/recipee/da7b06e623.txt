Add 14 ounces of warm water and 2 cups of whole wheat flour. Stir. Add vital wheat gluten, oil, honey & salt. Stir. Place bowl on mixer with bread hook. Add flour until dough forms a ball on the hook and isn't sticky to the touch. Knead on mixer for 10 minutes minimum, or 30 minutes by hand. Place dough in greased bowl and allow to rise, covered, for 1 hour. If you poke the dough, the hole should not fill up. Shape the dough into two loaves (or buns or whatever you're making). Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise 1 hour in a warm, draft-free place. Bake at 350F for 35-40 minutes.

Ironman Breakfast


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of oats


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 12 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt


 - 2-3 tablespoon of raisins, seeded


 - 1 tablespoon of honey


Instructions: 

Combine oats and water in a very deep microwaveable bowl. Microwave for 3-5 minutes, depending on your microwave wattage. (Alternatively, oats can be cooked on the stove). Remove oatmeal from microwave (careful, it's hot!) and stir in remaining ingredients. Can be made with more raisins, really it's up to your own raisin tolerance :). Sometimes I add slivered almonds or walnuts, depending on my mood and their availability.

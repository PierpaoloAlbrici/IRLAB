Champorado (Filipino Chocolate Rice Pudding) Recipe


Ingredients


 - 6 ounce of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022


 - 1 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 5 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1/3 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 3/4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Create a double boiler by filling a pot with 2 inches of water and bringing it to a simmer over medium-low heat. Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl and set it over the pot. (Do not let the water touch the bottom of the bowl.) Stir continuously until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth. Remove from the heat and set aside. Place the rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse it under cold water until the water runs clear. Transfer the rice to a medium saucepan, add the measured water, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the rice is tender and the mixture thickens, about 15 minutes. Add the sugar and melted chocolate to the rice, whisk to combine, and return to a simmer. Continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside until the pudding has cooled slightly but is still warm, about 45 minutes. (At this point, you can cool the champorado completely, transfer it to a container, cover, and refrigerate for up to 3 days.) Spoon the champorado into serving bowls and drizzle each with evaporated milk.

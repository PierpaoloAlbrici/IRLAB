### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of alcoholic beverage, distilled, vodka, 80 proof

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Pour water into a large bowl. In another bowl whisk together flour and salt. Sprinkle flour mixture over water then barely whisk the batter. There will be lumps. Strain through a fine mesh sieve. Pour the smooth batter into your iSi Creative Whip. Screw on one iSi soda charger not the silver cream charger but a gold soda charger. Shake vigorously about 5 times. Test your batter. It should look like fizzy, soft whipped cream. Dip lightly floured pieces of seafood, veggies like the green beans in the photo above or seasonal wild mushrooms immediately or you can let the batter chill in your fridge until youre ready to fry. To serve, preheat oil to 375F and fry battered pieces until light golden. Sprinkle with salt while still hot and serve immediately with or without a dipping sauce. Your finished tempura dishes will be light and crisp enough to challenge even a tempura master chef!

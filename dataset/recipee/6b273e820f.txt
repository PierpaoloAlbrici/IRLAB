Heartburn Remedy


Ingredients


 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Dissolve the baking soda in the water and drink it. (Preferably quickly, the taste is not very good). It should give you relief very quickly (but also cause an uncontrollable burp. ). I have also heard that a spoonful of vinegar or peppermint or chamomile tea will help, but this is what I take when it is bad and I need immediate relief.

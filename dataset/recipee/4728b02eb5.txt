Ingredients


 - 3 cup of oats


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, pistachio nuts, raw


 - 1/2 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 tablespoon of honey


 - 2 tablespoon of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 1/2 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 300 degrees F. Mix oats, pecans, pistachios, cocoa powder, brown sugar, and salt together. Set aside. Whisk together coconut oil, honey, and maple syrup until smooth. Pour coconut oil mixture over oat mixture and stir until moistened. Spread mixture evenly on an unlined, rimmed baking sheet. It should be a thin, single layer. Bake for 40 minutes, stirring every 20 minutes. Remove granola from oven and gently stir in semi sweet chocolate chips. Try to not stir too much, so you can get those really yummy clumps. Let it cool completely and enjoy! Note: This does take a while to cool. I let it sit out all day to harden, although its really delicious when its warm and gooey, too.

Ice Cream Waffle Cups


Ingredients


 - 12 ounce of butter, without salt


 - 4 cup of sugars, powdered


 - 1 1/2 cup of honey


 - 1 1/2 cup of egg, white, raw, fresh


 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


Instructions: 

Whip butter in mixer until smooth. Add powdered sugar and mix till smooth. Slowly add honey and egg whites. At flour 1/3 at a time and mix till smooth. Can use right away but works better when chilled. Cut out desired size circle in a piece of cardboard. I use a circle the size of a cereal bowl but bigger will work just as well. Preheat oven to 300F. Lay a non-stick pad on a cookie sheet. Then lay your cut out down on the sheet and spread a very thin but even layer of batter on it. Fill your sheet up then place in oven for a couple of minutes. You are going to have to watch it closely. When they start to bubble but are still pale it means they are getting close to being done. Pull them out when they are golden brown and immediately place them inside a bowl to shape. Sometimes a bowl of cold water is nice to stick your fingers in if they get burnt. You can make smaller circles and roll them up like a cannoli. They are great dipped in chocolate and sprinkled with toasted almonds and or toasted coconut. You can also fill them with whipped cream! **If you want add other flavors like almond extract, coconut extract, lemon extract, vanilla extract or what ever you heart desires, it adds a nice twist to the honey flavor!

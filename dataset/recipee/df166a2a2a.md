### Ingredients

 - 6 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 2 1/4 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 2 tablespoon of syrups, corn, light

 - 1 teaspoon of raspberries, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1/4 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 1 1/2 pint of ice creams, chocolate

 - 2 cup of goji berries, dried

### Instructions

Put the white chocolate in a microwavable bowl and heat at high power for 30 seconds at a time until half melted. Alternatively, put the white chocolate in the top of a double boiler over barely simmering water and stir until half melted, about 2 minutes. In a small saucepan, combine 1/4 cup of the heavy cream with the corn syrup and raspberry liqueur and bring just to a simmer. Pour the hot cream mixture over the white chocolate and whisk gently until smooth. Add the butter and whisk vigorously until slightly thickened and fudgelike, about 1 minute. Pour the remaining 2 cups of heavy cream into a large chilled bowl. Sift the confectioners' sugar and cocoa over the heavy cream. Beat at medium speed until soft peaks form. Scoop the chocolate ice cream into bowls and top with the hot white chocolate fudge sauce and a generous dollop of the cocoa whipped cream. Garnish with the berries and serve.

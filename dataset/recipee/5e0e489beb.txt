Peanut Butter and Honey Oatmeal


Ingredients


 - 1 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 dash of salt, table


 - 1 cup of oats


 - 14 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 18 cup of honey


Instructions: 

Combine the water, milk, salt and oats together in a medium saucepot over high heat. Bring to a boil, then turn the heat down to low and cook, stirring constantly for about 5 minutes or until the liquid is just absorbed. Stir in the peanut butter (I love to use extra chunky - then you get wonderful peanut chunks in your oatmeal which is my favorite), cover the pot and turn off the heat. Let the pot sit on the burner with the heat off and covered for 5 minutes, then uncover and stir. Serve topped with the honey - use less or more than the specified amount according to your tastes.

### Ingredients

 - 1 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/2 cup of oil, safflower, salad or cooking, high oleic (primary safflower oil of commerce)

 - 3 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Blend flour and salt. Add in oil and mix with fork to create dough. Sprinkle water over dough to mix well. Press into a ball and divide in 2. Roll out between sheets of waxed paper. One crust 9 inch pie. This is an excellent pie crust recipe. When you mix it up add in just a tad extra oil if the mix appears too dry - otherwise when you roll it out, it will break up when you put it in the pan. I leave one side of wax paper on the rolled out crust dough and remove it after pressing dough into the pie pan.

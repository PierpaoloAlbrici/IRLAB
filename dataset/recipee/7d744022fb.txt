Ingredients


 - 6 pound of pork, fresh, loin, tenderloin, separable lean only, raw


 - 1 1/2 cup of catsup


 - 34 cup of sugars, brown


 - 12 cup of vinegar, distilled


 - 12 cup of honey

Instructions: 

Cut ribs into serving-size pieces; place with the meaty side up on racks in two greased 13-in. x 9-in. baking pans. Cover tightly with foil. Bake at 350 for 1-1/4 hours or until meat is tender. Remove racks; drain and return ribs to pans. Combine the remaining ingredients; pour over ribs. Bake, uncovered, for 35 minutes or until sauce coats ribs, basting occasionally. Ribs can also be grilled over medium-hot heat for the last 35 minutes instead of baking. Yield: 12 servings.

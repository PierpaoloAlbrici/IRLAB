Caribbean Coconut Curry Sauce


Ingredients


 - 23 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


 - 12 cup of lime juice, raw


 - 6 tablespoon of onions, spring or scallions (includes tops and bulb), raw


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, curry powder


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Whisk cream of coconut and fresh lime juice in small bowl until smooth. Stir in green onions, curry powder, cayenne pepper and salt. (Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Brush half of sauce over chicken or seafood before and during grilling. Pass remaining sauce separately. NOTE: I usually serve this dish with a side of frijoles negros (black beans) and saffron rice cooked with pineapple juice instead of water.

### Ingredients

 - 14 cup of ice creams, strawberry

 - 12 cup of strawberries, raw

 - 34 cup of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 18 cup of alcoholic beverage, tequila sunrise, canned

### Instructions

In a Blender: Place all ingredients in a blender. If you want a stronger drink add the tequila. Blend until well blended (about 15-20 seconds). Pour into a tall glass. The drink will be foamy when made this way. In a glass: Pour the 7up (or Club Soda) into the glass first to prevent the drink from foaming. Add the Tequila Rose and Margarita Mix and mix well. If you want a stronger drink, add the tequila and stir until well mixed. Garnish with a strawberry if you want to. Now sit back and relax and enjoy your drink. Warning! If you add the extra tequila you might not be able to taste it. This can cause more than one drink to sneak up on you.

Milk-Rich Bread (12 x 12 x 24 Pan)


Ingredients


 - 490 g of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 340 ml of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 6 g of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 35 g of sugars, granulated


 - 20 g of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 8 g of salt, table


 - 30 g of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Add the milk first, then add all the other ingredients to your bread maker. Allow to rise. Separate into 3 pieces, with each piece being about 320 g. Make into round shapes, cover with a cloth, and let sit for 20 minutes. Spread margarine in your pan. Fully deflate the dough and place it in your pan. Allow to rise for a second time. It should expand to fill up 80% of the pan. Bake at 180C for 30 minutes. Immediately remove from the pan and cool. Using the milk rich bread recipe I tried making Danish bread. Please give it a try.

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of orange juice, raw

 - 13 cup of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

Note: You should put the freezer bowl of your ice cream maker in the freezer ahead of time so that its frozen when ready to use. In a medium size bowl, mix together the yogurt and sugar. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or foil and chill in the refrigerator for at least 45 minutes. Once chilled, remove the mixture from the bowl and place in the frozen freezer bowl of an ice cream maker. Turn the maker on and let mix for at least 20 minutes, or until thick and creamy. Serve immediately or refreeze! Recipe yields 2 cups of frozen yogurt.

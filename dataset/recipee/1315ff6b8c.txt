No Eggs, Food-Allergy Friendly Spongecake


Ingredients


 - 110 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 20 g of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 60 g of sugars, granulated


 - 1 tablespoon of vinegar, cider


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 120 ml of water, bottled, generic


 - 50 ml of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 5 drop of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 160C. Coat the inside of cake pan with butter. Sift together flour, cocoa powder, and baking powder. Add baking soda, sugar, and salt to dry ingredients and mix well. Add chilled water, and stir, then add vegetable oil and blend until evenly distributed. Stir in vanilla extract, then add apple cider vinegar and mix. Pour batter into mold, and be sure to cover the top with aluminum foil. Bake for 20 minutes at 160C, then for 15 minutes at 150C. It is done when a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean. While it is still hot, cover with a large bowl to retain heat until it cools to room temperature. Once completely cooled, remove from mold and wrap carefully to prevent it from drying. Store in the refrigerator overnight, then it's ready to decorate. Bake two of these sponge cakes to make a layered birthday cake. Spread maple syrup on top of the bottom layer, then whipped cream and strawberries. Next, place the top layer of sponge cake on top and coat with whipped cream, decorated with sliced strawberries and cut kiwi fruit. Please feel free to decorate as you like. You may use any kind of vinegar, such as grain vinegar or rice vinegar, but based on my experience, apple cider vinegar came out tasting the best. At first, when you add the vinegar, the smell is strong enough to make you wonder if it's really okay, but once it is baked, the smell disappears, so don't worry. Here it is as a Christmas cake decorated together in 2006. And again as a birthday cake in 2007. The sweetness is milder than regular sponge cakes, and was a hit.

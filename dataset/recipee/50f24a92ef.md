### Ingredients

 - 150 g of tofu, raw, regular, prepared with calcium sulfate

 - 100 g of okara

 - 70 g of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1 tablespoon of honey

### Instructions

Fry the okara in a frying pan to evaporate the water. It is good if the okara is a little wet like this. Add all of the ingredients to a bowl. Microwave the tofu for 1 minute, add it to the bowl, and knead. Let it sit for 10 minutes and then divide into equal portions and shape. Spread the dough into an ellipse and fold into thirds, leaving one end open. Then bring the opposite end around and tuck into the open end. Dissolve the honey in boiling water, and boil the dough for one minute on each side. Bake in the oven at 200C for 20~25 minutes until they turn a nice golden brown, and they are done.

Place beef in a bowl; add all marinade ingredients and allow to marinate for 20 minutes. Pre-heat wok until very hot. Add the peanut oil, and heat until oil smokes a little; then stir-fry beef until lightly browned (3-5 minutes). Remove from wok and drain well in a colander set inside a bowl to reserve oil. Wipe the wok clean and re-heat over high heat. Return 1 tablespoon of reserved oil to the wok, and stir-fry the onions and garlic for 1 minute. Mix in all ingredients listed under sauce, and let mixture simmer for 3 minutes. Return the beef to the wok and toss to coat thoroughly with sauce. Serve immediately.

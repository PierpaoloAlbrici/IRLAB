Pork and Beans Appetizer


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of bacon, meatless


 - 14 ounce of beans, snap, green, raw


 - 1 cup of sugars, brown


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Open and drain the can of green beans. Take five to seven green beans and wrap them in to a piece of bacon. Do not use a tooth pick to hold them together. Set the wrap down on a metal baking pan with the seam down to keep it from unraveling. With the baking pan is full sprinkle brown sugar over the top of the wraps. The brown sugar is very important to the flavor of the wraps. Bake until bacon is cooked. Remove from pan and place on a warm plate or serving tray.

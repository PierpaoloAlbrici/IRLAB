 - 1 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F. Grease 9 x 13 inch baking dish and spread half of your potatoes on the bottom of the dish, overlapping as necessary and then layer half of your onions. In a small separate bowl, mix your flour, butter, salt and pepper then sprinkle half of this mixture to make the next layer and then on top of this layer half of your cheese and the repeat to create your second layer and now add milk and cook for 45 minutes or until the potatoes are good and tender (Just to warn you this is supposed to look pretty soupy. To be safe, you might want to put a piece of aluminum foil underneath your pan in case of run over,).

### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of vinegar, cider

 - 1 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1 1/3 cup of catsup

 - 14 cup of butter, without salt

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of sauce, worcestershire

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 2 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Place the vinegar, sugar, ketchup, butter, hot pepper sauce, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, red pepper flakes, mustard powder, salt, and pepper into a saucepan. Bring to a simmer over high heat, and then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer about 30 minutes longer, stirring occasionally. Remove from stove and pour into a heatproof bowl. Cover, and refrigerate the sauce for 2 days. Strain the sauce through a sieve to remove the red pepper flakes. Store the sauce in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature before serving. To serve, slow cook your meat (in whichever method you prefer). When done pull the meat with a fork (it should be so well cooked, it just falls off). Add sauce and toss to coat completely. Enjoy!

### Ingredients

 - 14 cup of butter, without salt

 - 12 pound of carrots, raw

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 teaspoon of sugars, granulated

 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 ounce of cheese, cheddar

### Instructions

In a 2-quart saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat, then add the carrots & cook, stirring, until they are covered with the butter. Add salt, sugar & hot water, then bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low, & cook until soft, about 20 minutes. Drain, reserving the cooking liquid, then transfer the carrots to a blender & process until smooth, adding a little of the cooking liquid. Return to the saucepan with the remaining liquid & bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low & stir in the cheese, while simmering until the cheese melts ~ The texture should be like that of heavy cream. Add additional salt, pepper or sugar as needed, then serve.

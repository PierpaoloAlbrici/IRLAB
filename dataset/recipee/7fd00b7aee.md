[7fd00b7aee](http://www.food.com/recipe/vienna-cream-frosting-better-than-cream-223501)

### Ingredients

 - 14 pound of butter, without salt

 - 1 3/4 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 2 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

Beat the butter in a small bowl with an electric mixer. You need to beat it for a fair length of time -until it is as white as possible. Gradually beat in half of the sugar, all the milk and then the remaining sugar. If you would like the mixture thicker- add in some extra icing sugar one spoonful at a time until the consistency is right. If the mixture is too thick- gradually (and I mean gradually) add in some more liquid until the consistency is achieved. ). VARIATIONS:. To make it chocolate- add in 2 or 3 tablespoons of cocoa with the sugar and a little extra milk if required. Coffee- add 3 teaspoons of instant coffee in 2 tablespoons of hot water(omit the milk). Lemon- substitute lemon juice for the milk. You can also add in some lemon zest. orange- use orange juice in place of the milk. Different colours/flavours- add food colouring and flavours of your choice (in place of some liquid in the recipe). For pink I add some rosewater and a few drops of cochineal.

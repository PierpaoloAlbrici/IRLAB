### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 2 tablespoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

1. Thoroughly combine all ingredients. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. (I usually add almsot twice the amount of salt.) 2. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator. Helpful Hints You can make your own blanched almond flour for this recipe by grinding slivered almonds in a food processor or blender until it becomes a finely ground flour. If you prefer, you can grind the sesame seeds in a coffee grinder (maybe a blender or food processor). Just remember that the recipe calls for 2 tablespoons before grinding. Many cheese recipes call for nutritional yeast. I personally do not like nutritional yeast so did not include it in this recipe, but if you like nutritional yeast feel free to add some.

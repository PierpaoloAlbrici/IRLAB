### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 tablespoon of honey

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 tablespoon of applesauce, canned, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid (includes usda commodity)

 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

### Instructions

Simply add ingredients in order shown and start on the rapid setting. (My note: this is order for my B&D bread machine. I used the light crust setting. ). Note from the original cook: I've had much better luck with the rapid setting than the whole wheat setting. Note from the original cook: Because whole wheat flour is heavy I use 2 pkg of yeast. If you only have one pkg, make this with the whole wheat setting or the setting that allows the most rise time.

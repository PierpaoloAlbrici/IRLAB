Creamy Homemade Ricotta


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 3/4 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Add ingredients to a 4-quart pot. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat. Meanwhile, line a sieve or fine mesh strainer with a few layers of cheesecloth and place it over a deep bowl or pot. Once curds begin to separate from the whey (liquid temperature will be between 175 degrees and 200 degrees ), remove from heat. Gently spoon or ladle the curds into the cheesecloth-lined strainer. You may need to gently gather the cheesecloth at the top to help the curds drain. Let curds sit in cheesecloth to drain liquid for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how creamy youd like your ricotta. Store in refrigerator for up to two days.

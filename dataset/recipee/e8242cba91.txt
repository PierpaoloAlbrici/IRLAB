Classic Irish Soda Bread


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 1/2 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat over to 400 degrees. Whisk flours, sugar, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt in large bowl. Work softened butter into dry ingredients with fork or fingertips until texture resembles coarse crumbs. Add buttermilk and stir with fork just until dough begins to come together. Turn out onto flour-coated work surface; knead until dough just becomes cohesive and bumpy, 12 to 14 turns. (Do not knead until dough is smooth or bread will be tough). Pat dough into a round about 6 inches in diameter and 2 inches high; place on greased baking sheet and cut a cross shape into top. Bake until golden brown and a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean; 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven and brush with melted butter; cool to room temperature, 30 to 40 minutes.

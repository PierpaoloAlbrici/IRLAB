### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of onions, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

### Instructions

The measurements for the ingredients are per part. For a 6-quart crock pot, I used 6 pounds of onions and 2 sticks of butter. Next time, Ill use my 18-quart roaster, and hopefully 18 pounds of onions and 6 (!) sticks of butter. Use any onion you like. Yellow onions are usually cheapest. They will be very sweet when they are done, so only use sweet onions if you *really* like the sweetness. Slice onions 1/2-inch thick. Pile them into the crock pot and fill it as much as you can. Top with pats of butter. Turn crock pot on low. Stir after a few hours, and leave overnight. These can be put into containers to refrigerate, or they can be canned. To can: sterilize jars and lids. Fill with onions, and replace lids. Process. The possible uses are endless.

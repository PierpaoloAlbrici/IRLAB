### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of nuts, pistachio nuts, raw

 - 1 pound of figs, dried, uncooked

### Instructions

Bring a saucepan of water to the boil, add the nuts and boil for one minute, then rinse under cold running water. Remove and discard the outer skins and place the nuts on a paper towel. Trim the stems and peel the outer skins of the figs, quarter and then roughly chop or mash them. Place them in a bowl, cover tightly and chill. Chop the nuts. Churn the prepared ice-cream base in the ice-cream maker for about five minutes. Mix the nuts with the figs and fold into the cream. Continue to freeze according to the manufacturer's directions, then transfer to air-tight containers for storage.

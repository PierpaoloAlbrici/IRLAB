Butterscotch Fruit & Nut Bars


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 34 cup of sugars, brown


 - 3 tablespoon of orange juice, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of honey


 - 12 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 12 cup of nuts, walnuts, english


 - 3 tablespoon of raisins, seeded


 - 34 cup of oats


 - 1 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350F, line a 9 x 11 inch (28 x 18 cm) pan with parchment paper, or spray it with non-stick cooking spray. Melt the first four ingredients together in a saucepan, stirring occasionally. Wave the pot to cool. Combine the dry ingredients and then add the melted butter mixture (making sure it is not so hot that the chocolate chips will melt). Spread the batter in the prepared pan and press it into an even layer with a spoon. Bake until the top has a light golden colour (set but not solid as it will crisp as it cools), around 15-20 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool on the baking sheet until tepid, then cut into portions. Remove from sheet when cool and store in an airtight container.

Strawberry Pineapple Soda


Ingredients


 - 1 pint of strawberries, raw


 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 cup of pineapple juice, canned or bottled, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid


Instructions: 

Combine the strawberries and sugar in a small bowl and let sit for about 20 minutes, until the mixture is very wet. Combine the mixture with the pineapple juice in a blender or food processor and puree. Set a strainer over a small bowl and scrape the puree into the strainer, so that the liquid drains into the bowl below. Stir the puree gently as it strains to get as much liquid as possible without forcing any solids into the strained liquid. Discard the solids, reserving the liquid. You should have about 2 cups. The puree can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 day, but is best if used immediately.

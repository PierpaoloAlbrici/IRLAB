Cut the cold butter into small pieces. Set aside. Put flour in a bowl, and, with a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour until the mixture is crumb-like. Add salt and milk, stir well. If dough is too dry, add milk, a little at a time. Form dough into a ball and cover bowl with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least an hour and up to a day. If you need, you may wrap the whole ball of dough in plastic wrap and freeze for several weeks.

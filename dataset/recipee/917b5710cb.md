### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of carrots, raw

 - 6 tablespoon of salad dressing, italian dressing, commercial, regular

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 450F. Cut carrots into 1-1/4-inch-thick slices. (If carrots are thick, cut lengthwise in half before slicing for more even roasting.) Place in foil-lined shallow baking pan. Toss with 2 Tbsp. of the dressing; cover with foil. Bake 20 min. Remove foil; stir. Bake an additional 20 to 25 min. or until carrots are crisp-tender, stirring occasionally. Toss with the remaining 1/4 cup dressing just before serving.

### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of ground turkey, raw

 - 12 cup of sauce, salsa, ready-to-serve

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, basil, dried

### Instructions

Start by crumbling the raw turkey meat in a large bowl. Pour in the salsa and the rest of the spices. Mix all ingredients in well with the meat. (You may add extra or less of a particular seasoning if you'd like) Form 4 patties with the meat mixture. Try not to make them too tightly packed, because when they cook they puff up a little and get pretty thick. Spray a large skillet with olive oil cooking spray and put it on medium heat. Cook the four burgers for about 6 minutes on each side, until browned and cooked all the way through. (you may also grill the burgers). Put the burger on a bun, add cheese and whatever other toppings you would like. I mixed light mayo and salsa together to make a creamy sauce to spread on top of my burger. You could also sub the light mayo for light sour cream. ENjOY!

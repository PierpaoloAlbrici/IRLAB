Montecaos de Mamine


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 cup of sugars, powdered


 - 1 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees, and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Pour the oil or butter into a mixing bowl. Stir in the confectioners sugar and almonds, mixing well. Mix together the flour, salt, baking powder, and half the cinnamon. Add to the oil mixture, and stir until blended. Cover the batter with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. If, when you remove the batter from the refrigerator, it is a bit runny, then just add a little more flour to make it hold its shape. Scoop up a level tablespoon of cookie dough and mold it with your hands into a ball. Repeat, using all the dough. Arrange the balls about 2 inches apart on the baking sheet, and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until beige-colored, changing the position of the cookie sheets halfway through.

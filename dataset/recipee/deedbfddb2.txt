Diet-Friendly Okara & Yogurt Scones


Ingredients


 - 100 g of okara


 - 100 g of pancakes, plain, dry mix, complete (includes buttermilk)


 - 100 g of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


Instructions: 

Put all of the ingredients into a bowl and quickly mix them together. Divide the resulting dough into 6 portions and form each portion into a ball. Then bake them in a preheated oven at 200C for 20 minutes. Serve these scones with your choice of jam. I used raspberry jam this time.

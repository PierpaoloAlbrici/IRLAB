Danish Apple Pudding


Ingredients


 - 12 pint of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, powdered


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 12 cup of sugars, brown


 - 2 cup of delallo, italian seasoned breadcrumbs, upc: 072368104621


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 2 cup of applesauce, canned, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid (includes usda commodity)


 - 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 14 cup of nuts, almonds


Instructions: 

Whip cream, 2 tbsp icing sugar and vanilla extract until soft peaks form (approximately 3 minutes - but it depends on the cream). Place butter in a skillet and melt over medium heat. Add brown sugar, bread crumbs, and cinnamon. Mix well and cook, stirring constantly, to toast the crumbs, 3-5 minutes. Let cool completely (you may need to break up some of the crumbs if they've clumped together - this is easily down in the processor). Set aside 1 tbsp of crumb mixture. Spread 1 cup of crumbs in a large bowl. Mix the lemon juice into the applesauce. Spread 1 cup of applesauce over crumbs. Next 1/2 of the whipped cream; then the last of the crumbs. Finally, another cup of applesauce and the balance of the whipped cream. Sprinkle with the toasted almonds and reserved bread crumbs. Chill for at least 3 hours. Serve spooned into sherbet glasses or sauce dishes.

Coconut Ice Cream


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 3 tablespoon of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


 - 12 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


Instructions: 

Dissolve the coconut milk powder in the hot water in a large bowl. Whisk until all large lumps are gone. Add the pastry cream filling mix to the heavy cream, again whisking until no lumps remain. Mix the coconut "milk" and pastry/heavy cream together. Add the sugar and coconut flavor. Add the shredded coconut, if using. Place the bowl in the fridge to chill for several hours, or up to overnight. Freeze in a 1-quart ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's directions. The ice cream will be dense and soft when finished. Enjoy right away for a soft-serve treat, or chill in the freezer for 4 to 6 hours to harden. TIPS:. Love Almond Joy or Mounds candy bars? Add chopped chocolate and/or nuts, up to 1/2 cup total, during the last 5 minutes of churning for a tasty treat. If you don't care for the shredded coconut texture, leave it out. No pastry cream filling mix? You can leave out this ingredient, but the ice cream will be less smooth, rich, and creamy. It's definitely worth adding!

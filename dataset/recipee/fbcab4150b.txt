Berry Cordial


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 quart of blackberries, raw


 - 1 quart of alcoholic beverage, distilled, vodka, 80 proof


Instructions: 

Pour the sugar into a 1 quart jar. Fill the remaining space with berries, but do not pack down. Fill the jar with vodka so that the berries are completely covered. Seal the jar. Let the jar stand for 2 months, shaking the jar every week. The sugar should dissolve, and the vodka will become colored. Strain the liquid through a metal sieve, and then through a coffee filter to remove the fruit. Pour into pretty bottles. Drink as a cordial, or use it to flavor lemonade or iced tea.

Cajun Spiced Edamame


Ingredients


 - 1 quart of water, bottled, generic


 - 4 ounce of crustaceans, shrimp, raw (not previously frozen)


 - 1 pound of edamame, frozen, prepared


 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Bring the water to a boil in a medium sauce pan. Once enough water is boiling to submerse the edamame, add the crab boil. (Note: Its important when using liquid crab boil that you wait until right before you add your food to the water to add the crab boil. It will steam up if you add it before the water boils and not only evaporate out, but if youre boiling a big pot it will choke out everyone in the house!) Once boiling and liquid crab boil is in the water, add the edamame. Turn off the heat. Let it soak no less than 5 minutes but longer if you like it spicier. The longer it soaks the hotter it gets. Drain the water and sprinkle liberally with sea salt. When serving, make sure your guests know not to eat the pods or outside casing. Just scrape or bite down gently to push the soybeans out.

Cheddar Cheese Straws


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 cup of cheese, cheddar


 - 3/4 cup of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Grease or line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Combine the flour, baking powder, cayenne pepper, salt, grated cheese and butter or margarine in a bowl and mix until well combined. Add water a little bit at a time to make a very stiff dough. On a lightly floured surface, roll pieces of the dough into just slightly thicker than pencil shaped sticks. Cut sticks into 4 to 5 inch lengths. Arrange the pieces on the baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 5 minutes or until browned.

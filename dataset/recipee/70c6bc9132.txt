Dark Chocolate Truffles with Orange


Ingredients


 - 13 cup of beverages, almond milk, unsweetened, shelf stable


 - 1 tablespoon of orange juice, raw


 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 13 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


Instructions: 

Place almond milk in the top of a double boiler (over about two inches of simmering water in the bottom pan) over medium heat. If you dont have a double boiler, just put a heat-proof mixing bowl (in other words, not plastic) over a pan of gently simmering water. If using a flavoring (optional), add it now and let it steep for five minutes. For this batch I used fresh orange zest but you could try all sorts of things like chopped candied ginger or you could even steep a tea bag (peppermint or earl grey is great) in the milk. After 5 minutes, turn off heat and immediately add chocolate, stirring until it melts and the mixture is smooth and glossy. Pour melted chocolate into a heat-proof bowl, cover with plastic wrap and place in the freezer for one hour (or in the fridge for a few hours). Place the cocoa powder (or raw cacao) in a shallow bowl, sifting with a fine mesh strainer to remove clumps. When chocolate is set (you can add a tablespoon of cocoa powder directly to the mixture and stir if its still too watery), scoop out 1 tablespoon of the dough at a time, roll into a ball between your palms, and roll in the cocoa powder to coat. Set on a parchment lined tray. Repeat with remaining chocolate and enjoy! Note: You can also roll them in finely chopped nuts or dried coconut.

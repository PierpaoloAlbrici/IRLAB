Zingy Little Smokies


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of pork sausage, link/patty, unprepared


 - 14 cup of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 12 cup of grapes, red or green (european type, such as thompson seedless), raw


Instructions: 

In a sauce pan place all the ingredients. Warm it on low simmer until the grape jelly and mustard combine to form a yummy sauce. (Approximately 20 minutes). People will not believe that the sauce is only grape jelly and mustard. You can make up something that sounds more expensive if you wish. Works nicely in a crock pot as well.

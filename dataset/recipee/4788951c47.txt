Great for Valentine's Day Spiral Chocolate Rolls


Ingredients


 - 120 g of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 30 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 100 ml of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 15 g of butter, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


Instructions: 

Other than the processed cocoa, add everything into a bread machine and set it to make the dough. Let it run till the first rising is done. You can knead it by hand if you would like! Consult my blog if you need help. Transfer the dough to a working surface. Gently punch the dough till it forms the shape of a ball. Gently cover it with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 15 minutes. Roll out the dough to a 20 x 24 rectangle. Sprinkle the cocoa over the top. From the bottom, roll it up. Round and round. Once you're done rolling it up, tightly seal off the ends. Divide the dough into 6 portions. Since it's 24 cm long, each portion should be 4 cm long. Put them in a muffin tray. If you don't have a muffin tray, then a pudding tray will work as well. Let the dough sit and rise for 30-40 minutes until it expands 1.5 to 2 times larger. Next, in a preheated oven, bake them for 12-15 minutes at 350F (180C). They are done. They'll look cute if you arrange them like this. Their fluffy texture adds to their deliciousness.

Candied Cherries


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of cherries, sweet, raw


 - 1 cup of apple juice, canned or bottled, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

In a large saucepan, combine the cherries, water or apple juice, sugar, and lemon juice. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the juices are quite syrupy and thickened to the consistency of warm honey, 15 to 20 minutes. If you like, you can use a candy thermometer to gauge doneness; the mixture should register about 220F (105C). Transfer the cherries to a jar. Let cool, then cover and refrigerate. The cherries in their syrup will keep for at least 6 months in the refrigerator. To boost the cherry flavor, stir 1/8 teaspoon almond extract or 1 teaspoon amaretto liqueur into the cherries just before placing them in the jar. You can double or even triple this recipe, to take advantage of the cherry season. If you do make a big batch, simmer a lemon half or a lemon slice or two with the cherries, then remove it before transferring to the jars.

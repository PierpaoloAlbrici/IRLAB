### Ingredients

 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated

 - 8 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 4 to 5 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Combine the flour, salt, and sugar in a large bowl and stir briefly until the mixture is aerated. Using a pastry blender or your fingers, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until its in pea-size pieces that are slightly yellow in color, about 4 to 5 minutes. Drizzle in 4 tablespoons of the ice water and mix just until the dough comes together. (Add the last tablespoon of ice water if necessary, but dont overwork the dough or itll become tough.) Shape the dough into a flat disk, cover it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, then use it in the pie or tart recipe of your choice.

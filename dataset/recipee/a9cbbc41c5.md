### Ingredients

 - 60 ml of water, bottled, generic

 - 50 g of sugars, granulated

 - 20 g of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 130 g of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 150 ml of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 2/3 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Chop the chocolate finely and put in a bowl. Put the water and sugar in a sauce pan. Once the sugar has dissolved, sift in the cocoa powder with a tea strainer while stirring it all with a whisk. Add the heavy cream. Just before the mixture made in step 2 comes to a boil, take it off the heat, then pour it into the bowl used in Step 1 and mix it all together. Once Step 3 is smooth, add the oil and mix it in well. Once the mixture made in step 4 has cooled to 30C, place a sponge cake on a cake cooler and place a plate under it. Coat the cake with the icing made in step 4. On this cake, it is covered with cream under the icing. However, in case of Sachertorte, the space between the layers of cake and the sides are covered with apricot jam, and then covered with icing. It takes about 30 minutes for the chocolate to harden, so it can be left at room temperature or put in the fridge uncovered. Once it has set, move it to something like a cake box. Because the outside will not harden completely, be careful when you cut the cake. If you warm the knife before cutting the cake, it will cut neatly. This makes a little bit too much icing, so if you have any left over, please use it on things like pancakes, bread and crepes. It will hold for 10 days. If you let the cake sit for a day or more after making it, the chocolate will infuse with the cake and will make it more delicious. Ganache cream for a Christmas cake

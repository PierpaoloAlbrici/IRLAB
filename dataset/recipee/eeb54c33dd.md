### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350. Place hazelnuts on a baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes, stirring once halfway through cooking. Note: at this point, the recipe states to rub the skins off, but I left them on. Coarsely chop nuts. Combine nuts, cherries and ginger in a medium bowl. Place chocolate in a microwave safe measuring cup. Microwave at high for 1 minute (or until melted) stirring every 15 seconds. Add nuts and fruit, stirring just until combined. Spread mixture evenly on a jelly roll pan lined with foil; freeze. Break into pieces.

[7ab521f388](http://cookeatshare.com/recipes/bloody-bug-juice-87162)

### Ingredients

 - 24 ounce of strawberries, raw

 - 6 ounce of lemonade, frozen concentrate, white, prepared with water

 - 1 quart of beverages, carbonated, ginger ale

 - 1 cup of raisins, seeded

 - 1 cup of blueberries, raw

### Instructions

Place the strawberries in a bowl and mash with a fork. In a large pitcher, mix the strawberry mash, lemonade and ginger ale. Place handfuls of raisins and blueberries (bugs) into tall glasses. Pour the liquid over the bugs, then sit back and watch the bugs and scum rise to the top of each glass. To quench a creepy crowd's thirst, double or possibly tripple this recipe and serve in a punch bowl. Drape some gummy worms over the rim of your bowl for a particularly swampy-looking effect!

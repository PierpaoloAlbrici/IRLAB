Tart Crust for Quiche


Ingredients


 - 65 g of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 65 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched


 - 60 g of butter, without salt


 - 50 ml of water, bottled, generic


 - 3 g of salt, table


Instructions: 

Be sure to keep all of the ingredients chilled. After combining the ingredients to create salt water, put it in the refrigerator. Grease the pan with butter. Add all of the ingredients to a bowl. Use a scraper to mix together by covering everything with flour. When the butter has become pebbly and crumbly, cut it up with the scraper. Make a dent in the center and pour in the salt water. Fold it into itself and bring the dough together to form one lump until the flour has been completely mixed in. Cover it with wrap and let it sit in the refrigerator for 3 hours. Roll out the dough until it's 1-2 cm thick. Lay out the dough into the tart mold and pierce with a fork. Gently push the sides of the dough into the mold. Leave it as-is in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Cut off the edges of the dough, fill with pie weights, and bake for 20 minutes at 200C. Take out the pie weights, and let it finish cooking on its own for 5 minutes.

### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

### Instructions

In a small, heavy saucepan, heat the oil and red pepper flakes over low heat, stirring occasionally, until a thermometer inserted into the oil registers 180F, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. Transfer the oil and pepper flakes to a 4-ounce bottle or other small container and seal the lid. Refrigerate up to 1 month.

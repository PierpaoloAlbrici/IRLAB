In a frying pan, brown ground beef. Drain. Add remaining ingredients and drained ground beef into a 6 quart pot. Cover and simmer 1 to 1 1/2 hours, stirring every 15 minutes. A note added: "Dave likes to add fresh, chopped onions on top of his chili serving. ". My note: I'm guessing that by "small red beans" he meant pinto beans. This yields 16 (8 ounce) servings.

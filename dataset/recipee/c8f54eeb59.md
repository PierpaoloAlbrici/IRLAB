### Ingredients

 - 75 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched

 - 30 g of sugars, powdered

 - 30 g of nuts, almonds

 - 15 g of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 5 g of strawberries, raw

 - 60 g of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Bring the butter to room temperature. Sift together all the ingredients except the butter and strawberry powder. Use a rubber spatula to cream the butter which has been brought to room temperature. Add the dry sifted ingredients from step (2) all at once and mix. After it's mixed together, add the strawberry powder and gather the dough together. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. (I make the dough the day before and leave it in the refrigerator for a day) Heat the oven to 170 degrees C. Roll the dough into 2 - 2.5mm (5 g) balls and place on a baking sheet, leaving a space between each cookie. Bake for about 15 minutes in a 170 degrees C oven. (The cookies will be very soft when you take them out) Mix 40 g of powdered sugar and 5 g of strawberry powder (not listed in the ingredients) in a bowl. When the cookies have cooled off a little, coat them in the sugar and strawberry powder mixture from step (8). (You can use extra strawberry powder if you want) They're done!

### Ingredients

 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 2 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 34 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Place butter and cheese in a bowl, beat until creamy. Add the flour and pepper and continue to beat until the mixture is combined. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Tear off four 10-inch pieces of waxed paper and roll each portion of dough into a log. Shape and wrap in the waxed paper. Squeeze the ends so that you get a nice even log. Freeze for 2-3 hours. Preheat your oven to 400F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment or a silpat sheet. Slice the dough into 1/8inch slices. Place the discs at least 1-inch apart and bake until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove and cool,.

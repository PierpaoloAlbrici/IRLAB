Monkey Bread Minis


Ingredients


 - 34 cup of butter, without salt


 - 3 tablespoon of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 13 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 13 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 34 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Position a rack in the bottom third of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees. In a small bowl, microwave 4 tablespoons butter and the maple syrup at high power until melted, 30 seconds; stir. In a small bowl, stir together 1/3 cup granulated sugar, the brown sugar and the cinnamon. In a food processor, combine the flour, baking powder, the remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar and the salt; pulse to combine. Cut the remaining 1 stick chilled butter into small pieces and pulse with the flour mixture until coarse crumbs form. Pulse in the buttermilk until the dough just comes together. Transfer to a lightly floured work surface; pat into a 10-inch square (the dough will be sticky). Quarter the dough, then cut each quarter into 16 equal pieces; roll into balls. Dip each ball in the maple butter, then coat with the sugar mixture. Place 5-6 coated balls into each cup of a muffin pan coated with cooking spray and press to compact. Bake until cooked through and golden, 15-17 minutes (tent with foil if the tops darken too quickly). Transfer the muffin pan to a rack and cool for 10 minutes. Using a knife loosen the sides of the monkey bread; invert onto a platter then turn right side up. Serve warm. You could also drizzle the minis with frosting made by combining 1 cup powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons milk.

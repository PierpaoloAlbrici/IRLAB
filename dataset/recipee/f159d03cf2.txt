Pumpkin Seed Bread


Ingredients


 - 1 1/8 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow


 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 1 1/3 cup of seeds, pumpkin and squash seeds, whole, roasted, without salt


Instructions: 

Dissolve 1/8 teaspoon of the yeast in 1 cup of the water. Stir in 1 3/4 cups of the flour. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand overnight in a warm spot. Dissolve the remaining 1 teaspoon of yeast in 1/4 cup of the water. Put 1 cup of the cornmeal in a large heatproof bowl. Bring the remaining 1/4 cup of water to a boil, then stir it into the cornmeal and let cool. Stir in the salt, both yeast mixtures and the remaining 1 1/3 cups of flour to make a soft dough. Transfer to a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 15 minutes. Knead in the pumpkin seeds. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 hour. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and gently fold 4 times. Return the dough to the bowl, cover and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Sprinkle a baking sheet with cornmeal. Turn the dough out onto a work surface and divide in half. Shape each half into a round loaf. Set the loaves on the baking sheet and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Set a pizza stone on the middle rack of the oven and preheat the oven to 500. Fill a roasting pan with water and set it on the bottom rack. Make 3 slashes in the tops of the loaves; transfer them to the stone and bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 450 and bake for 20 minutes longer. Let the loaves cool on a rack for 45 minutes before slicing into eighths.

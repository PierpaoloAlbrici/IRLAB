Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350F. Whisk together flour, baking soda and salt in a small bowl. Melt butter in microwave at low temperature. Stir in cocoa powder sugar, and brown sugar. Add the yogurt and vanilla extract, stirring gently until mixed. Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Add to chocolate mixture until just combined. Fold in the cherries or chocolate chips at this time. Drop tablespoonfuls of batter onto a parchment or silicone mat lined baking sheet. Press cookies down slightly to flatten (they do not spread much). Bake at 350F for 9-12 minutes or until set and slightly firm at the edges. Cool on the pan for a few minutes to set the bottom then finish cooling them on wire cookie racks.

Ingredients


 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt

Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the butter, honey and maple syrup. Stir until combined. Add the pancake mix and stir until fully incorporated. Fold in the chocolate chips. Use a medium cookie scoop (or a tablespoon) to drop the dough (it will be pretty thin) onto the prepared trays. Leave about 2 inches of space between cookies. Bake at 350 degrees F for about 15 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from oven and allow cookies to cool for a couple of minutes on the tray, then cool completely on a wire rack. (Recipe adapted from Little Bitty Bakes.)

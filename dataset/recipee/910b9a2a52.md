### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of butter, salted

 - 1 cup of cheese, cottage, creamed, large or small curd

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Cream butter, cottage cheese and salt together until combined. Stir in flour until no dry spots remain; dough will be sticky. Use a spatula to move the dough to the center of the bowl into a rough ball, cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight until the dough is manageable. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and divide into thirds. Roll each third into ball and flatten into a disk. Cut each disk into 8-12 wedges using a pizza cutter. Roll each wedge starting with the widest side and place the pointed side down onto a lined baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F for 2530 minutes or until golden brown. While rolls are cooking, prepare the glaze. Combine butter, vanilla, and sugar. Drizzle in water until its the consistency youd like, mixing until smooth. Drizzle rolls white still warm with the glaze and serve.

Delicious Raspberry Cordial Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1 quart of alcoholic beverage, distilled, whiskey, 86 proof


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 quart of raspberries, raw


Instructions: 

Dissolve sugar and whiskey in a 2 qt jar or possibly glass jar. After sugar is all dissolved, pour in the berries. Cover and let stand till the berries become very bland looking and the whiskey turns raspberry colored, about 1 month. Drain the juice. HAPPY HOUR - ENJOY! Do not throw away the berries - they're loaded, and they taste good. I once threw them into the garden, the pigeons ate them and got loaded and couldn't fly away.

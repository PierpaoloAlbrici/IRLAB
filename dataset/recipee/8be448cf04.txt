Cranberry Scones


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/4 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 8 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1/2 cup of cranberries, dried, sweetened


 - 1 tablespoon of orange juice, raw


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In a bowl, stir together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut 8 tablespoons cold butter into small pieces. Using a pastry blender, cut in cold butter until mixture is crumbly. Add buttermilk and water and stir with a form until completely combined and sticky dough forms. Chop half of the dried cranberries into small pieces and leave the remaining whole. Add cranberries and orange peel to dough and fold gently. On a lightly floured surface, form dough into a ball. With lightly floured hands, pat the dough into a 10-12 inch diameter circle. Score the circle into 8 wedges. Place each wedge onto baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake 18-20 minutes until lightly browned. Immediately, gently brush melted butter on tops of scones. Serve warm with jam and/or Devonshire cream.

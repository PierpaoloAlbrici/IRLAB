Raspberry-Marinated Chicken


Ingredients


 - 1/3 cup of jams and preserves, apricot


 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 1/8 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

Whisk raspberry jam, lemon juice, salt, ginger, and pepper together in a bowl; add chicken and turn to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight. Remove chicken from the marinade and shake to remove excess liquid. Discard the remaining marinade. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken in oil until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

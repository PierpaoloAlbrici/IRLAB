### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of ground turkey, raw

 - 8-10 ounce of cheese, feta

 - 8 ounce of cranberries, dried, sweetened

### Instructions

Mix all the above listed ingredients in a large bowl. Depending on how you like it you can use more or less Cranberries. The Feta cheese will keep the turkey moist. Grill over medium heat. If you feel the need to put something on this burger, may we suggest Spinach Artichoke dip. Nothing else.

Mike's Fruity Tropical Breezes


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


 - 1 dash of pineapple juice, canned or bottled, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid


 - 1/4 cup of ice creams, vanilla


Instructions: 

Feel free to make this recipe as you chose to. Basically, in every 8 to 10 oz of your drink, you'll have 1+ tbs Greek Coconut Flavored Yogurt, 1 shot of rum, about a 1/4 of a cup of whole milk, a sweetner - or vanilla ice cream - and the rest is entirely up to you. So, get stupid with this recipe girl and make it your own! In a Magic Bullet or blender, add your ice, fruits, sweeteners and thinners to your tastes. But, 1/2 ice and 1/2 fruits + additions is typical regardless of the size of your blender(s). Usually, I make a blend of flavors in seperate containers. Or, I take requests from my guests. Once fully blended, add your alcohol and mix it in gently by hand. Work it out to at least 1 shot per 8 - 12 oz glass. Blueberry / Berry Banana, Banana Pineapple Cantelope & Strawberry Orange Mango flavors are pictured below. You can pour these drinks immediately. Your result will be the last picture in this step: #4. Or, you can create the defined layered look pictured. Just place your containers back in the freezer for two to three minutes. Have them set up just slightly then, layer drinks as pictured below. This technique will reduce any chance of early bleeding. Garnish drinks any way you chose. Oh, one small tip. If you want more vibrant colors in your drinks, feel free to add a drop of food coloring to each flavor. I know my friends have no clue I do this since they're constantly asking me how it is my drinks always look so festive. pfft.....suckers! ;0) In Memorandum: I regret to inform you that today, my Magic Bullet, finally bit it's own magic bullet. So, I was forced to move on and use an ancient, more pedestrian blender. Believe it or not, this was the exact moment he passed on. RIP little buddy. RIP. :0(

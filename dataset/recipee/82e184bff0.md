### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 8 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 8 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 2 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

### Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 450 degrees F. 2. Combine dry ingredients in a large, shallow bowl. 3. Slice cold butter into thin pats. DO NOT soften your butter! Place the cold butter chunks in the bowl and cut into the flour mixture until it looks crumbly. Basically, you want to chop the butter into tiny pieces, no bigger than peas. You can do this using a pastry cutter if you have one, but knives, a cookie cutter, or an apple slicer would work as well. 4. Make a well in the center of the mixture and pour in the buttermilk. 5. Stir with a wooden spoon until just combined. 6. Roll out onto a well-floured surface and cut into 2 rounds, OR scoop and shape 2 rounds with your hands and place on an ungreased baking sheet. 6. Bake about 20 minutes or until they start to brown. 7. Enjoy!

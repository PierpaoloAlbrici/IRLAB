Easy Maple-Proofed Pizza Dough for One


Ingredients


 - 34 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 14 teaspoon of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 18 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 1/3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


Instructions: 

Put the maple syrup in the water in a large bowl and dissolve the yeast in it. Let it proof for 10-15 minutes or until nice and foamy. Add the oil and salt. Knead the flours in until nice and elasticy, about 5 minutes. Loosely cover with parchment paper or a dish towel and let rise for 20-30 minutes. Simply roll out into a 10" pie plate greased with cooking spray or a little olive oil. I suggest poking some holes into the dough with a fork after rolling out, then baking for 7-8 minutes at 400F Then add your sauce, cheese, toppings, etc. and bake for another 10-20 minutes depending on how much you put on it, then turn on the broiler for 5 minutes for a nice crispy crust and top.

[ef01d04777](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/desserts/easy-icing-for-brownies/)

### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt

 - 13 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 6 tablespoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 16 ounce of sugars, powdered

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

### Instructions

This recipe goes with my Brownies recipe which youll find in my TastyKitchen recipe box. Its enough to cover a full batch of brownies. If you only make half of the brownie recipe I posted, then you will have about half of the icing left over. 1. Add the butter, milk, and cocoa into a large saucepan. 2. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, for about 5 minutes or until it is completely melted. 3. Remove the pan from the heat. Beat in the powdered sugar at medium speed until smooth. Add in the vanilla. This icing never sets and gets hard like some. It will create a shell on top of the brownies and youll have gooey goodness underneath.

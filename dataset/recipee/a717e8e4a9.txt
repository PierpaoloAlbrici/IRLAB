Comfort Classic Cheesy Broccoli


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of broccoli, raw


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 34 cup of cheese, cheddar


Instructions: 

Steam the broccoli if using frozen. In an 8x8 pan, layer the broccoli florets evenly then sprinkle with black pepper, as much as you'd like. Top with the cheese and bake at 400 F for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown on top. Use the broiler to speed it up a bit. Wonderful with some potatoes added!

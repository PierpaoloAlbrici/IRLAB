[6478190142](http://www.food.com/recipe/pesto-rice-with-pine-nuts-375016)

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 5 tablespoon of sauce, pesto, classico, basil pesto, ready-to-serve

 - 12 cup of nuts, pine nuts, dried

 - 2 tablespoon of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 12 cup of cheese, mozzarella, low sodium

### Instructions

Cook the rice in the hot water, simmering over a low heat in a covered pan for around 20 minutes, until all the water has been absorbed. When the rice is fully cooked, remove from the heat. Add the pesto sauce, pine nuts and parmesan cheese. Stir to mix well. If the rice has had a chance to cool at all, you may wish to reheat it at this point- the rice should be hot enough for the mozzarella to melt slightly. Serve onto plates and top with the grated mozzarella if desired. Enjoy!

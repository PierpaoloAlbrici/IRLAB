Instructions: 

Combine all ingredients, except chicken, in a small sauce pan. Heat over medium heat until smooth and slightly warmed. Roll each piece of chicken into the sauce and place in a greased, 9 x 13-inch baking pan. Bake uncovered for 30 minutes at 375F (Cook for less time if you are using chicken breast tenders). Spread remaining sauce over chicken and bake for a few more minutes until chicken is done. To freeze: Prepare sauce ingredients in a small zip-top bag. Put chicken breasts in a larger zip-top freezer bag. Put both bags together into another bag with cooking directions inside as well. Label and freeze for up to 4 months. To serve: thaw overnight in refrigerator. Drain chicken and proceed with step 2 above.

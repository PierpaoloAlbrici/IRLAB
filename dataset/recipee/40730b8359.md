Put all of the ingredients in the bread maker and press start on the dough course. Once done, take the dough out and leave to rest for 10 minutes. Roll the dough out into a 20 x 20 cm square, cover with the filling and roll it up like a roll cake. Make sure to secure the edges. Making sure the dough doesn't dry out, prove for a second time until doubled in size. Whilst preheating the oven to 180C, insert 5 slits onto the top of the dough and then bake for 25 minutes. You can also make this with chocolate cream.

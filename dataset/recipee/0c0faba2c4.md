### Ingredients

 - 7 teaspoon of seeds, flaxseed

 - 7 teaspoon of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

 - 7 tablespoon of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

### Instructions

In your blender, process the seeds on high for 2 minutes. In a saucepan, add coconut oil and heat on low until melted. Do not heat up higher than low, and do not keep the coconut oil over heat for more than is necessary. You want to keep it as raw as possible. Add peanut butter and mix thoroughly. Once the peanut butter is mixed well with the coconut oil, add the flaxseed meal and mix again. Pour mixture into a sterile mason jar and keep in the fridge for a week.

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of nuts, walnuts, english

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

### Instructions

Saute nuts in olive oil and add spices. They burn quickly, so just warm them! I recommend these walnuts on top of chopped romaine, grilled chicken, red sliced onions, cubed avocado, gargonzola, and Goddess salad dressing.

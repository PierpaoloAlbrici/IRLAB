Salt and Pepper Chocolate


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022


 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, chili powder


 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Working simultaneously but in separate bowls, temper the bittersweet and white chocolates as directed in Basic Tempered Chocolate (page 163). (You can use the same chocolate thermometer for tempering both chocolates; just wipe it thoroughly with a dry towel each time you switch bowls.) Once the chocolates are tempered, take both bowls and pour the chocolates at the same time onto a sheet pan lined with parchment or waxed paper, criss-crossing them so that the bittersweet and white chocolates swirl together. Shake the pan gently to spread the chocolate (it doesnt need to be level, but it should be no more than 1/2 inch thick at the thickest part). Sprinkle the chili powder and sea salt evenly across the surface of the chocolate. Then use a toothpick or skewer to further marbleize the chocolates and mix in the salt and chili powder. Allow the chocolate to set at room temperature for 1 hour (or 30 minutes in the refrigerator). Using a chefs knife or your hands, cut or break the chocolate into 2-inch shards. Serve the chocolate immediately, or keep it in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 weeks.

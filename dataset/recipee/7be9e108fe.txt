Pita Bread


Ingredients


 - 300 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 5 g of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 5 g of sugars, granulated


 - 5 g of salt, table


 - 190 ml of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

Divide the dough (that has already completed it's first rising using a bread maker) into 8 pieces. Round the dough and place them on a canvas cloth with the sealed end at the bottom. Let them sit for 15 minutes. After letting the dough sit, use a rolling pin to flatten them into 7-8 mm thickness. Place 2 pieces of flattened dough per cooking sheet and cover them with a damp cloth. Let them sit for 15 minutes for a second rise. Bake in the oven for 2-4 minutes on the cooking sheet at 230F Celsius. Once the pitas rise, remove them while still on the cooking sheet. Wrap them in cloth to prevent them from drying out. Bake the rest in the same fashion. Place all of the freshly baked pitas into a plastic bag and let them cool. Carefully pat off the condensation. Cut into halves and stuff with your favorite fillings.

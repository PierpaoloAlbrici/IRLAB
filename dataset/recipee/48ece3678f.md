### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of beans, snap, green, raw

 - 3/4 cup of oats

 - 1/4 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Stir the garbanzo bean flour, oats, cornmeal, cinnamon, and baking powder together in a mixing bowl until evenly blended. Stir in the water until only small lumps remain. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat until a drop of water skitters across the surface. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, and cook until the edges are dry. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side, about 3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining batter.

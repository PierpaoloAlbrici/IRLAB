Caramel Nut Acorn Cookies


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 3/4 cup of sugars, brown


 - 13 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract


 - 2 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 14 ounce of candies, caramels


 - 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 cup of nuts, pecans


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350F (180C). Melt the butter in a 2-quart sauce pan. Remove from the heat. Stir in brown sugar, vanilla, and the finely chopped pecans. Add flour and baking powder, mixing well. Shape rounded teaspoons of dough into rounds with slightly peaked tops. Place on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 15 to 18 minutes. Remove to a rack to cool. In a double boiler, melt the caramels with the water. Remove from the heat. Dip the bottom flat ends of the cookies into the caramel and then into the chopped pecans. Place on waxed paper until caramel is thoroughly set. Makes about 3 dozen cookies. Make It Easier: Place the nuts for dipping into a disposable aluminum pie tin. Discard after using to make clean-up simpler.

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 3 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

Whisk, or sift the dry ingredients. Cut the butter into the flour, with a pastry blender, until it resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the milk. Add any optional ingredients, if desired. On a floured surface, lightly knead the dough 5-10 times. Place on a greased, or parchment lined, baking sheet. Flatten gently to a 1" thick round. Cut, like a pie, into 8 wedges, but do not separate. Brush the top with about 1 tablespoon milk. Sprinkle with sugar, if desired. Bake 400 degrees, 12 -15 minutes, until golden brown.

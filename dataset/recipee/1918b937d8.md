 - 1 tablespoon of orange juice, raw

 - 1 1/2 pound of nuts, pecans

 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 300. In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat; add in liqueur and orange zest; stir until blended. Remove the pan from heat, add in the pecans, and toss to coat well. Spread the nuts evenly on a large baking sheet and toast in the oven, uncovered, until golden brown, about 30 minutes, tossing the nuts from time to time. Drain on paper towels, sprinkle salt on top; let cool completely, and serve in crystal bowls with cocktails.

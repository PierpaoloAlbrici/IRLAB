### Ingredients

 - 1/2-1 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular

 - 13 cup of pickle relish, sweet

 - 13 cup of onions, raw

 - 2 cup of lettuce, cos or romaine, raw

### Instructions

Stir together the lettuce, onion, and pickles. Add the mayonnaise to the desired consistency. Cover and refrigerate at least one hour to let the flavors marry before serving. NOTE: The key here is to get the lettuce fine enough it doesn't become something you're pulling off your burger at the first bite. Make sure it's fine, but not overly chopped.

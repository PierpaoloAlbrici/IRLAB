Tofu and Miso Spritz Cookies


Ingredients


 - 70 g of tofu, raw, regular, prepared with calcium sulfate


 - 10 g of miso


 - 20 g of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 15 g of sugars, granulated


 - 70 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 180C. Put all the ingredients except for the cake flour into a bowl, and mix well with a whisk. Sift in the cake flour, and fold it in with a cutting motion. Do not knead. When the mixture is no longer floury, put in a icing bag. Since it has a high water content, squeeze it out as thinly as possible. If the mixture is too hard to pipe, soften with milk to loosen the batter. Turn down the oven temperature to 170C, and bake for 30 minutes until golden brown. If you'd prefer soft cookies, take them out before they brown.

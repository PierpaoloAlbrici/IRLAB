Mean Old Fudge Sauce


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 34 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 1/3 cup of sugars, brown


 - 13 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 1 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


 - 12 cup of syrups, corn, light


 - 2 tablespoon of syrups, corn, light


 - 2 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 teaspoon of alcoholic beverage, distilled, rum, 80 proof


Instructions: 

In a heavy saucepan, combine cream and butter. Cook and stir over medium-low heat until butter is melted. Add the sugars and salt; cook and stir until sugars are dissolved, about 4 minutes. Stir in cocoa and syrup. A wire wisk helps to dissolve the cocoa. Cook and stir until cocoa is dissolved. Add chocolate squares; cook and stir until melted. Reduce heat to low; cook for 3-4 minutes stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla and rum extract if desired. Cool slightly. Sauce will thicken as it cools. Serve warm over ice cream. Refrigerate leftovers.

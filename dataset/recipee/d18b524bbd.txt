Bread Machine Dog Cookies Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


Instructions: 

Use dough cycle. Roll dough to 1/4" thickness. Cut with cookie cutters or possibly knife. Place on baking sheets sprinkled with cornmeal. Cover with clean kitchen towels and let rise in hot place about 45 min. Bake at 325-degrees for 45 min. When all are baked, turn off oven and return all cookies to cooling oven overnight to harden. Store in airtight container. [Using a 3.5" bone shaped cutter, I get about 30-35 cookies from this recipe. Sam the Wonder Dog adores them.]

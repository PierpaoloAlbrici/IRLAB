Cream Cheese Potato Soup


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 4 cup of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry


 - 1/4 cup of onions, raw


 - 1/4 cup of celery, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 8 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 1/4 cup of potatoes, raw, skin


Instructions: 

In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, combine potatoes, broth/stock, onions, celery, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and cook (with the lid slightly off so steam can escape) over medium heat until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Smash the potatoes with a potato masher until all large pieces are broken up. Reduce heat to low and add the cream cheese (works best if the cream cheese is at room temperatureI learned this the hard way). Heat, stirring frequently, until the cheese melts. Add the instant potatoes, cover, and remove from the heat. Allow to sit for 23 minutes. Stir and serve, garnished with extra cheddar cheese, scallions, bacon, etc.

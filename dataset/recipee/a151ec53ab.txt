Combine flour, baking powder, milk powder, and salt in a large bowl. Cut the shortening in until the mixture is crumbly. Add the water and mix until the dough comes together. Place on a lightly floured surface and knead lightly until smooth. Cover with a dishcloth and let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Heat the oil in a large high-sided saute pan until it reaches 350 degrees F. Divide the dough into 8 pieces and roll each piece out into a 4-inch circle. Fry the bread in the hot oil until golden brown on both sides. Remove to a sheet pan lined with paper towels and season with salt.

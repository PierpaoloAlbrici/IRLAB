Instructions: 

Line a 11 by 17 jelly roll pan with foil, lightly spray with cooking oil. Put the chocolate disks in a large microwave safe bowl. Microwave for one minute and stir. Microwave for 30 more seconds and stir. Continue to microwave for 30 second intervals, stirring after each until chocolate is just melted. Gently stir in the mini pretzels until well mixed. Add the m& m candies and stir gently and quickly (you do not want them to melt when you are stirring them! ). Pour the candy mix onto the foil lined pan, using a spatula to spread to a thin layer. Let cool completely. Break into chunks of bar and enjoy!

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 14 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 23 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 12 cup of onions, raw

 - 14 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 3/4 cup of potatoes, raw, skin

 - 34 cup of cheese, cheddar

 - 13 cup of cheese, cottage, creamed, large or small curd

 - 18 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 16 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table

### Instructions

DOUGH: Combine flour, baking powder add salt in food processor. Process for 3 seconds. With motor running, slowly add cooking oil and enough warm water through feed chute until a ball begins to form. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Knead 3 to 4 times until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap. Let stand for 20 minutes. ONION BUTTER: Saute onion in butter in small saucepan on medium-low for about 10 minutes until onion is soft but not brown. Keep hot. TWO CHEESE POTATO FILLING: Mix first 4 ingredients in medium bowl until Cheddar cheese melts and mixture is evenly moist. Makes about 2 1/4 cups filling. Divide dough into 4 equal portions. Roll out 1 portion into a rope about 12 inches long. Keep other portions covered. Cut at 1 inch intervals. Press balls slightly to flatten. Cover with plastic wrap. Stretch and press 1 ball to about 2 1/2 inches in diameter or roll out with rolling pin. Place in palm of hand. Place about 2 teaspoons filling centre. I like to make the potato filling a day ahead so that it is cold. Fold dough in half. With well floured fingers, pinch edges firmly together to seal. Edges of dough may be moistened if desired. Arrange in single layer on lightly floured tea towel-lined baking sheet. Cover with tea towel to prevent drying. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Cook varenyky, in batches, in boiling water and salt in large pot or Dutch oven for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until varenyky float to top. Allow to bob for 1 minute. Remove using slotted spoon. Drain. Turn into large bowl. Drizzle some Onion Butter over each varenyky batch. Gently shake to mix and prevent sticking. Makes 4 dozen varenyky. VARIATION: Add 6 bacon slices, cooked crisp and crumbled, to Two Cheese Potato Filling. VARIATION: After varenyky are cooked, saute, in batches, in 2 teaspoons butter in frying pan until lightly browned. TO MAKE AHEAD: Place filled varenyky (cooked or uncooked) on baking sheet, in layers between waxed paper or parchment paper. Cover. Freeze until solid. To remove varenyky, hit baking sheet on counter to pop them off. Store in resealable freezer bags in freezer. To cook from frozen, do not thaw. Boil, as above, increasing cooking time after they float to top. Serve with sour cream.

Chocolate Ganache Glaze


Ingredients


 - 6 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 3/4 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


Instructions: 

Place the chopped chocolate in a bowl. Scald the cream. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and gently stir to melt all the chocolate. This can be made up to 3 days before and reheated slightly for use. The glaze should drizzled over the puffs when its room temperature, or slightly warm, but still liquid. If the glaze is hot, it will drip too much.

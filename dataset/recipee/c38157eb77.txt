Easy Mug Cup Steamed Bun Cake in the Microwave


Ingredients


 - 3 tablespoon of pancakes, plain, dry mix, complete (includes buttermilk)


 - 2 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Combine the pancake mix and the milk in a heatproof container, such as a coffee mug. The amount of the pancake mix is rounded tablespoons shown in the photo, it does not need to be exact. Stir the ingredients well in the cup until smooth. Cover the container loosely with plastic wrap and microwave it for 1 minute and 30 seconds!! Without the plastic wrap, the batter may bulge up and come out of the container... It is done. It's very fluffy. You can make various flavors and it can be a perfect snack for you and your child. This is the cocoa flavored version. Add 1/2 tablespoon of cocoa powder at Step 1. Addendum: I have learnt from one of the users that adding 1 tablespoon of milk helps the cake rise if the regular way isn't doing the trick! Please try this if your cake did not rise too much.

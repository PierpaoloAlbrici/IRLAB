### Ingredients

 - 4 pound of figs, dried, uncooked

 - 4 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 tablespoon of vinegar, distilled

### Instructions

Cut stems off figs, wash, prick well all around with fork. Place water, sugar and vinegar in saucepan, stir until sugar dissolves. Bring to the boil. Place figs in boiling syrup, reduce heat, simmer very slowly, uncovered 21/2 to 3 hours. Drain figs, place on fine wire rack and stand on oven tray. Place in dehydrator set at 140F or 60C and dehydrate for 24 hours, turning every few hours. They may not take quite as long depending on size of figs and where they are in the dehydrator.

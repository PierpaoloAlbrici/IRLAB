Stir in the superfine sugar and chocolate chips. Mix in enough milk to form a soft dough. You may not have to use all the milk. On a floured surface roll the dough to form a rectangle 4x6 inches and 1 inch thick. Cut the dough into 9 squares. Place on cookie sheet spacing them well apart. Brush with a little milk and bake in a preheated 425F oven for 10-12 minutes, until biscuits are risen and golden. Let cool slightly and serve warm with a bit of whipped cream or a hazelnut spread.

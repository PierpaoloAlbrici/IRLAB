### Ingredients

 - 2 1/2 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of honey

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 3 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Stir together the high-gluten flour, whole-wheat flour, sugar (if using), salt, powdered milk, and yeast in a 4-quart mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the shortening, honey (if using), and water. Stir (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment) until the ingredients form a ball. If there is still flour in the bottom of the bowl, dribble in additional water. The dough should feel soft and supple. It is better for it to be a little too soft than to be too stiff and tough. Sprinkle high-gluten or whole-wheat flour on the counter, transfer the dough to the counter, and begin kneading (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook). Add more flour if needed to make a firm, supple dough that is slightly tacky but not sticky. Kneading should take about 10 minutes (6 minutes by machine). The dough should pass the windowpane test (page 58)and register 77 to 81F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Ferment at room temperature for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the dough doubles in size. Remove the dough from the bowl and press it by hand into a rectangle about 3/4 inch thick, 6 inches wide, and 8 to 10 inches long. Form it into a loaf, as shown on page 81. Place the loaf in a lightly oiled 8 1/2 by 4 1/2-inch bread pan. Mist the top with spray oil and loosely cover with plastic wrap. Proof at room temperature for approximately 90 minutes, or until the dough crests above the lip of the pan. Preheat the oven to 350F with the oven rack on the middle shelf. Place the bread pan on a sheet pan and bake for 30 minutes. Rotate the pan 180 degrees for even baking and continue baking for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the oven. The finished loaf should register 190F in the center, be golden brown on the top and the sides, and sound hollow when thumped on the bottom. When the bread is finished baking, remove it immediately from the loaf pan and cool it on a rack for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours, before slicing or serving. Enriched, standard dough; direct method; commercial yeast 10 to 15 minutes mixing; 3 1/2 hours fermentation, shaping, and proofing; 45 to 60 minutes baking This is one formula that is not greatly improved by the preferment or sponge technique. Because it is made by the direct dough method, though, this formula is especially good for bread machines.

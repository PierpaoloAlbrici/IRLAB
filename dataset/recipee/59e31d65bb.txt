Skillet Biscuit Bread


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 34 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 14 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

Combine flour, buttermilk, and oil in a large bowl and stir with a fork (do not overmix). Using floured hands, gently knead dough in bowl to form a ball; dough will be sticky. Generously oil a straight sided, heavy 8 or 9 inch skillet and set over medium heat. Pat dough into skillet. Cook over medium heat until set and browned in spots on the bottom, 7 to 8 minutes. Using a spatula, slide or lift onto a plate. Invert into a skillet and cook until other side is browned in spots and bread is thoroughly cooked, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a plet and cut into wedges; serve hot, warm or at room temperature.

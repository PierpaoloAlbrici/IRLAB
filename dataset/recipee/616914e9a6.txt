Smore Treats


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt


 - 10 ounce of candies, marshmallows


 - 8 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt


 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

Grease a 9x9 square pan and set aside. In a large saucepan, melt the butter and marshmallows over medium heat, stirring frequently, until smooth. Once melted and smooth, remove from heat and add half the cereal. Mix until combined, add the remaining cereal, and stir together. (If you like your bars to be more gooey, add less cereal. If you like them to be pretty dry/firm, add more cereal.) Add in the chocolate chips, quickly stir until incorporated, and dump into your greased pan. Using wet hands, press firmly into the pan and let cool before cutting into bars.

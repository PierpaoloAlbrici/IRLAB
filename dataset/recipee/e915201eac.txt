Caramel Whipped Cream


Ingredients


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 3/4 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


Instructions: 

Prepare an ice bath; set aside. Pour sugar into a small saucepan; cover and cook over medium-high heat, without stirring, until sugar is completely melted. Remove lid, and cook, swirling pan to cover evenly, until sugar turns golden amber. Carefully pour 3/4 cup heavy cream down the side of the pan in a slow, steady stream (it will spatter), stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until combined. Transfer caramel to a bowl set in ice bath; let sit until cool, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, whip the remaining cup cream until medium-stiff peaks form. Fold in the caramel until combined. Use immediately.

### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of brussels sprouts, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, onion powder

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, thyme, dried

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Remove the outer leaves from the Brussels sprouts and rinse well under cool water. Cut off any remaining stem and slice in half. In a large, nonstick skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add Brussels sprouts and sprinkle with garlic powder, onion powder, dry thyme, and salt. You can use more or less if you like. Saute in the skillet (stirring frequently) until sprouts are nicely browned (about 5 minutes). Add water to the pan and immediately cover with a lid. Continue to cook over medium heat with the lid on for approximately 5 minutes or until sprouts are tender. Remove the lid and add the butter. Toss the sprouts to coat with the butter and continue to cook for approximately 2-3 minutes more until sprouts are nicely caramelized.

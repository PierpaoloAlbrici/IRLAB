[20bde5760b](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/151764-versatile-crumble)

### Ingredients

 - 170 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched

 - 70 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 100 g of butter, without salt

 - 100 g of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

Cut the butter into about 1.5 cm cubes. Sift the cake flour and whole wheat flour into a bowl and add the cubed butter. Mix the butter with the flour, whilst cutting up the butter with a knife. Once the butter is in relatively small pieces, move onto the next step. Rub the butter into the flour with both hands to form a crumbly texture. Sprinkle in the raw cane sugar, and continue to rub the mixture with your hands until it is all mixed. It's perfect if the crumble can form a ball if you squeeze it. Place in a resealable bag and store in the freezer, where it will keep for about 1 month.

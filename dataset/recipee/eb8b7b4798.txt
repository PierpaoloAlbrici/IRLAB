Mix rub ingredients and set aside. With a good sharp fillet knife debone the pork shoulder. Coat all sides with the rub. Replace the bone and tie roast with butchers string (100% cotton). Coat all of the outside with BBQ rub. Wrap the roast with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Set up your grill for Indirect Heat with a drip pan in the middle. First layout unlit charcoal. Then add hot charcoal to the top. Add water to the drip pan. Placed roast on center of grill over the drip pan and add a few handfuls of wet hickory wood chips. Close the lid and smoke @ 275F to 300F until you have an internal temperature of 195F or higher. This should take 4 to 5 hours, or maybe longer. When done remove from the grill cover with aluminum foil and rest for 20 minutes. When cool shred the pork and serve on toasted buns with your favorite BBQ sauce. Serving suggestion: in some areas of the United States it is traditional to put coleslaw on a pulled pork sandwich.

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt

 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

Line jelly roll pan with graham crackers. Combine margarine and sugar in saucepan. Heat to boiling and boil 2 minutes. Remove from heat and pour over crackers. Sprinkle chopped walnuts over this. Bake 10 minutes at 350 degrees. Remove from oven and turn off. Let cool 2 minutes and sprinkle chocolate chips over top. Return to oven long enough to melt chips. Swirl chocolate over top. Cool 5 minutes and cut into squares. **These bars taste just like English Toffee bars. The key is to make sure that all the edges of the crackers are touching when you pour the margarine mixture over it. You may need to adjust a little bit. This way, when you bake the bottom layer, it forms a crispy crust. Paula Ruehrwein Omaha Ne

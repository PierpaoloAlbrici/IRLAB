### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt

 - 8 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 2 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 cup of raisins, seeded

 - 1 cup of nuts, walnuts, english

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1 cup of apricots, dried, sulfured, uncooked

### Instructions

Cream together the margarine and cream cheese in the bowl of an electric mixer. Blend in the vanilla. Mix in the flour. Chill the dough. To make the Filling: Mix together the chopped raisins, chopped walnuts, and cinnamon. If you have a food processor, place the whole walnuts and raisins into the bowl, sprinkle with the cinnamon, and chop them together by processing in short pulses. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions. Roll out each portion into a 10 - 12 inch circle 1/8 inch thick on a lightly floured board or between two sheets of waxed paper. Spread a light layer of preserves (approximately 2 tablespoons) onto each dough circle. Sprinkle each circle with approximately 1/4 cup of the chopped nut-raisin-cinnamon mixture. Cut each circle into 16 wedges using a pastry cutter or a pizza cutter. Roll each wedge from base to point. Place point down on a lightly greased or parchment lined baking sheets. Bake for 15-17 minutes at 375 degrees F (or until golden). Remove to racks to cool.

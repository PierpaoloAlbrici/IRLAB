Molasses Glazed Carrots


Ingredients


 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 3 pound of carrots, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of molasses


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 6 tablespoon of vinegar, balsamic


 - 2 tablespoon of parsley, fresh


Instructions: 

Melt butter in heavy extra-large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. Add carrots, 1 tablespoon molasses, and 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt; saute until carrots are coated with butter mixture, about 1 minute. Add 4 tablespoons vinegar and enough water to almost cover carrots (about 3-4 cups) and bring to boil. Cover and boil 2 minutes. Uncover and boil until liquid is reduced to syrup and carrots are tender, stirring often, about 20 minutes. Add remaining 1 tablespoon molasses and 2 tablespoons vinegar to carrots and toss over medium-high heat until carrots are heated through and thickly coated with glaze, about 3 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon parsley. Season carrots to taste with more coarse salt and generous amount of ground black pepper. Transfer carrots to large bowl; sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon parsley and serve.

Fresh Blueberry Sauce


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of blueberries, raw


 - 14 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 cup of orange juice, raw


 - 34 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 14 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 3 tablespoon of cornstarch


 - 12 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 18 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


Instructions: 

In a saucepan over medium heat, combine blueberries, 1/4 cup water, orange juice, and sugar; stir gently. Bring to a boil. In a small bowl, mix cornstarch and 1/4 cup cold water. Gently stir into the blueberry mixture, so as not to mash the blueberries. Simmer gently until thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon; 3-4 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in extract and cinnamon. Sauce can be thinned with water if too thick.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Combine all ingredients in a large bowl. Be certain to thoroughly coat all ingredients with coconut oil and honey. Prep a large baking sheet or cookie sheet with coconut oil (or line with parchment paper for quick clean up). Spread granola mixture onto pan in one level layer and place in oven for roughly 35 minutes. At 30 minutes, start to peek at it often because it will burn quickly at the end! Granola is ready when lightly browned and your home smells like cinnamon goodness :).

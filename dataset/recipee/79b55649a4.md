### Ingredients

 - 1 1/4 cup of lemon juice, raw

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

Place the lemon juice in a non-reactive mixing bowl and set aside. Combine the water and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. When the sugar has dissolved, remove from the heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Stir the sugar syrup into the lemon juice and transfer to a stainless steel loaf pan. Place in the freezer, uncovered. When the top of the liquid forms an icy layer, scrape through entire pan with a fork. Return to freezer and let another frozen layer form; scrape again with fork. Repeat freezing and scraping steps until all liquid is frozen. Fluff with a fork to create soft, snowy granita. Wine Recommendation: Napa Valley Sparkling Wine

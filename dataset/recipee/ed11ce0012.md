[ed11ce0012](http://www.cookstr.com/recipes/artisanal-bakerrsquos-dough)

### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 3/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 1/4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Whisk the flour, yeast, and salt together in a large bowl, then pour in the milk and oil. Mix together with a large fork or your hands. Knead once or twice to form a ball. It may be sticky, but thats okay. Oil a bowl and set the dough in it. Lay a sheet of waxed paper loosely over the top, then cover with plastic wrap. Place a clean dish towel over the bowl and allow to rise at room temperature and undisturbed for 24 hours. Turn the dough once in the bowl about 3 hours before you want to use it. The 24-hour fermentation process takes the place of kneading the dough. When you are ready to make your pizza, divide the dough in half on a lightly floured board, then proceed with your pizza making. (The dough can be frozen for up to a month; thaw at room temperature before using.)

### Ingredients

 - 3 pound of chicken, broilers or fryers, wing, meat and skin, raw

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

 - 1 cup of sugars, brown

 - 34 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 12 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 34 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

### Instructions

Arrange wings in shallow baking pan. Heat butter, soy sauce, sugar, water mustard and garlic powder if using, until butter and sugar melt. Cool; pour over wings and marinate at least 2 hours, turning once or twice. Bake in same pan at 375F for 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours, turning occasionally. (Use the plumpest chicken wings you can find; if your market only has the normal scrawny ones, don't cook longer than 75 minutes) Drain on paper towels and serve.

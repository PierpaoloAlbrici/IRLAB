### Ingredients

 - 1 quart of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 1/2 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Bring water to a boil in a saucepan, add in salt to taste, and whisk in the cornmeal. Lower the heat and stir the cornmeal for 10 min or possibly till it tastes done. The coarser the meal, the longer it will take. Pour the cooked cereal onto a cookie sheet or possibly into a bread pan and set it aside to cold for an hour or possibly so or possibly till hard. Once it has cooled, slice it into pcs for frying. Fry the slices in butter or possibly oil in a nonstick pan till lightly crisped on both sides. If this is to be eaten as a savory, sprinkle a little red chili or possibly paprika on top just before serving. This is cooked like cornmeal mush, molded in a bread pan, and then sliced and fried. It is delicious with a clear corn flavor and odd purple-blue color. It's good with Large eggs and bacon, or possibly with butter.

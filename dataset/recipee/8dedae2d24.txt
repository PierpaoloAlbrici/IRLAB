Miner's Candy


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 cup of syrups, corn, light


 - 1 tablespoon of vinegar, distilled


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 12 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

Heavily butter a 9" x 13" pan. In a large, heavy kettle, add the sugar, dark corn syrup and vinegar. Stir just to mix ingredients. Place kettle over medium heat. DO NOT STIR! Boil mixture until it reaches 300 degrees on a candy thermometer. Remove from heat. Stir in the baking soda. Mixture will fizz! Mix baking soda in well and pour into the prepared pan. DO NOT TRY TO SPREAD MIXTURE. Trying to spread it will break the foam, just plop it in the pan. Cool and break into pieces. Melt chocolate chips in top of double boiler (a bowl placed in a pan of simmering water works fine as does the microwave). Dip candy in chocolate sit on wire rack (or if like me, you don't have one, set it on waxed paper).

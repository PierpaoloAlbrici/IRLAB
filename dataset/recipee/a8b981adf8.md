### Ingredients

 - 2 1/2 cup of dates, deglet noor

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, brown

 - 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 cup of oats

 - 1 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 18 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

In a saucepan combine chopped dates, 1 Tablespoon of brown sugar and water. Bring to a boil and cook until dates are soft enough to be mashed with a fork (about 5 minutes). Set aside to cool. In a separate bowl combine oats and your 1 cup of brown sugar. In another bowl cut in butter with flour, baking soda and salt (previously sifted together). It is best to work with cold pieces of butter as they are easier to cut into the flour. Once butter and flour are mixed together thoroughly, combine with oats and brown sugar. Press half of the oat mixture over the bottom of a greased 8 x 8 square pan. Pack the layer down firmly with a fork. Next place entire date mixture on top of the base, for the second layer. Cover and spread evenly. Cover with remaining oat mixture and pat until smoooth. Bake at 325 degrees Fahrenheit for 35 minutes or until a light golden brown. Cool before cutting into squares and serving.

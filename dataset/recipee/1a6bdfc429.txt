Steel-Cut Oatcakes


Ingredients


 - 3 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 3/4 cup of oats


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 14 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 2 tablespoon of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Butter (or use non-stick cooking spray) a 13x9x2-inch baking pan. Bring 3 1/2 cups water to boil in heavy medium saucepan. Add oats and salt. Bring to boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until oatmeal is tender but still firm to bite. Stir often and add more water by 1/4 cup fill if too thick. Cook about 20 - 30 minutes. Add cream, maple syrup, sugar and vanilla; stir until mixture thickens, about 3 minutes. Spread oatmeal in prepared pan. Cover with plastic wrap and chill until firm, at least 4 hours and up to 24. (Keep chilled until ready to griddle). Cut chilled oatmeal into squares or triangles. Heat griddle or heavy nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Brush griddle with butter. Cook oatcakes until golden brown and heated through, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Divide oatcakes among plates and top with your choice of toppings (maple syrup, berries or yogurt).

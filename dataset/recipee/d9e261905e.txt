Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 2 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 1/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 2 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1/4 cup of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


 - 2 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 tablespoon of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Prepare a shallow baking pan with cooking spray. Sift together the bread flour, whole wheat flour, salt, baking soda, and 2 teaspoons sugar in a bowl. Cut the margarine into the flour mixture until pieces are nearly indistinguishable. Make a well in the center of the mixture and pour in the oil and buttermilk. Stir with a spatula until dry mixture is completely moistened. Move the dough to a lightly-floured surface. Lightly knead the dough for no more than 1 minute. Place the dough into the prepared pan; pat down and around to form a round loaf. Cut a cross into the top of the loaf with your finger. Brush the top with 1 tablespoon buttermilk; sprinkle 1 teaspoon sugar over the top of the loaf. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C); rotate pan and bake another 30 minutes. Allow loaf to cool on a wire rack before slicing.

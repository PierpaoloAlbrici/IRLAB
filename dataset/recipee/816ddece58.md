### Ingredients

 - 100 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched

 - 3 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 20 g of sugars, granulated

 - 30 g of butter, salted

 - 2 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

Melt the butter in the microwave (about 20 seconds) and then mix in the sugar. Mix in the milk. Mix in the cinnamon. I love cinnamon, so I used 2 teaspoons. Add the flour and mix until no longer powdery, but don't over mix it. You don't need to sift the flour. It should look like this. Sandwich the dough between plastic wrap and roll out to 3-4 mm thickness. Cut out cookies with your preferred cookie cutters. Bake in an oven heated to 180C for 20-25 minutes. All done!

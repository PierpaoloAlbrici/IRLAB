Watermelon Granita


Ingredients


 - 1/3 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 3 1/2 cup of watermelon, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

In a small saucepan combine the sugar and 3/4 cup water, bring the mixture to a boil, stirring until the sugar is dissolved, and let the syrup cool. In a blender or food processor puree the watermelon. In a bowl combine the puree, the syrup and the lemon juice and chill the mixture, covered, for 1 to 2 hours or until it is cold. The mixture may be made up to this point 1 day in advance and kept covered and chilled. Stir the mixture, transfer it to 2 metal ice cube trays without the dividers or a shallow metal bowl, and freeze it, stirring it with a fork every 20 to 30 minutes depending on the temperature of the freezer and crushing the large frozen clumps, for 2 to 3 hours, or until it is firm but not frozen hard. Scrape the granita with a fork to lighten the texture and serve it in chilled bowls.

Knackebrot (German Crispy Bread)


Ingredients


 - 2 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3-4 tablespoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


Instructions: 

Mix and knead all ingredients throughly. Spread and roll dough thinly on a greased cookie sheet (only about 1/8th of an inch thick). Spread sesame seeds evenly on top of dough, and roll with rolling pin again to make sure seeds stick to the dough. Cut into rectangles (about the size of graham crackers), and make holes evenly with a fork. Bake for 20 minutes at 425 F (220 C). When done, don't put bread in any closed container, or it will get soft!

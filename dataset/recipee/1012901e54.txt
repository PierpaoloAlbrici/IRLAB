 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

Instructions: 

For the cookies: Position rack in center of oven; preheat to 350F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat. Process almonds in a blender in 2 batches until finely ground. Transfer to a large bowl and add flour, butter, sugar and salt. Knead the mixture with your hands until well blended. Gather the dough into a ball; divide it into 2 portions. Working with one portion at one time, roll the dough between 2 sheets of wax paper until 18 inch thick. Cut out cookies using a 2-inch circular cookie cutter. Using a metal spatula, place them 1/2 inch apart on the prepared baking sheet. (If you like, cut out the centers of half the cookies using a 1-inch any kind of shape cutter.) Gather the scraps, reroll and continue cutting out cookies until the dough is finished. Then the second portion of dough. Bake the cookies, one batch at one time, until puffed and beginning to color, 10 minutes. Cool on the pans for 3 minutes before transferring to a wire rack. For the filling and glazing cookies: Spread preserves on half the cookies; top with the remaining cookies to make sandwiches. Melt chocolate and 1 tablespoon butter in a double boiler over hot water. Change the heat to the low temperature to keep the chocolate melted; stir in milk and corn syrup until smooth. Line 2 or 3 baking sheets with wax paper. Dip each sandwich cookie halfway into the chocolate, then place on the wax paper. When all the cookies are dipped, refrigerate until the chocolate has set, at least 1 hour or longer. Serve.

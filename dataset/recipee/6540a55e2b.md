Spray a large casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray. Place potatoes in large saucepan; add water to cover and bring to a boil. Cook for 12 minutes or until potatoes are tender; drain. Let potatoes stand 10 minutes so they are cool to touch. Melt margarine in a small saucepan; blend in flour. Cook and stir for 3 minutes or until small clumps form. Slowly whisk in milk and cook for 8 minutes or until sauce thickens. Remember to keep stirring. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cut potatoes into thin slices; arrange half of potato sliced in casserole dish. Layer with half of the onion slices. Repeat layers. Spoon sauce over potatoes. Next, combine bread crumbs, finely chopped red onions and cheese in a small mixing bowl. Sprinkle bread crumb mixture evenly over sauce. Bake 20 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.

Riebeles (Swiss Fried Cornmeal Cakes)


Ingredients


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 1/3 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow


 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2-6 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Using a pastry brush, spread the softened butter on the bottom and sides of an 8"x6" or 9"x6" shallow baking dish. Set aside. Place milk, water and oil in a heavy 3-4 quart saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Add cornmeal in a slow, thin stream, stirring constantly, so that liquid continues to boil as cornmeal is absorbed. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15-20 minutes, stirring frequently, until mixture is so thick that spoon will stand unsupported in center of pan. Spoon into buttered dish while hot, spreading it out and smoothing the top with a spatula. Cover and refrigerate at least 6 hours, or overnight. Using a pastry wheel or sharp knife, cut the chilled cornmeal into 2" squares and gently lift them out of the dish with a small metal spatula. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large, heavy skillet over moderate heat. Add 4 or 5 of the cornmeal cakes to the pan and brown for 2-3 minutes on each side, turning gently with a spatula. Repeat with remaining cakes, adding more butter if necessary. Serve immediately.

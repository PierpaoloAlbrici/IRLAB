### Ingredients

 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

Grease 1 large baking sheet & set aside. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup warm water, then add the honey & let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in the remaining water, whole wheat flour, rye flour & enough all purpose flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface & knead until smooth & elastic, about 6 to 8 minutes. DO NOT LET IT RISE at this time. Divide dough into 16 pieces, then roll each into a 10-inch rope. Place each rope 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet, then cover & let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30 minutes. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees F & bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm.

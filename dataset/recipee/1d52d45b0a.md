### Instructions

Mix all ingredients except water in a bowl. Slowly add water until the dough forms a ball. You may not need all of the water! Roll out on a clean surface to about 1/3 inch thickness. Cut out shapes using the smallest cookie cutters you have. Continue to re-roll scraps until all dough is used. Place crackers on baking sheets lined with waxed paper. Bake at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes, until crackers are set and golden.

### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 cup of nuts, cashew nuts, raw

 - 3 tablespoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

 - 1 1/2 pound of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022

### Instructions

Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium saucepan, cook the sugar with the water over moderate heat, stirring just until dissolved. Simmer undisturbed until a light amber caramel forms, about 5 minutes. Stir in the cashews and sesame seeds and cook for 1 minute; immediately pour the caramel onto the lined baking sheet and refrigerate until set, about 15 minutes. Chop the brittle into 1/2-inch pieces. Pour the tempered chocolate into molds, filling them about halfway. Sprinkle the brittle on top and refrigerate until set, about 15 minutes. Unmold the chocolates and store at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.

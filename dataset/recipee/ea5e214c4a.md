 - 1 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 4 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Heat oven to 425 degrees. In a bowl, combine flour and salt. Blend in spread with a pastry blender (2 forks work just as well). Sprinkle in ice water 1 tablespoon at a time. Shape into disc and cover with plastic wrap and chill for 20 minutes. On floured surface, roll out dough into a 12 inch circle; transfer to pie plate. Chill 20 minutes. Pierce crust with fork and line with foil. Fill pie with pie weights (dried beans and/or rice also work well). Bake 10 minutes and remove pie weights and foil. Bake an additional 10 minutes more, or until golden. Cool completely.

Vanilla Rum Raisins


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 cup of alcoholic beverage, distilled, rum, 80 proof


 - 1 cup of raisins, seeded


Instructions: 

In a mason jar or other glass jar with tight fitting lid, add raisins and rum. Store in a cool dark place for at least a month to let the raisins plump and the rum to get good and flavored. Eat from the jar (if you dare!) or use raisins and rum in your favorite recipes - especially tasty when added to oatmeal cookie recipes (leave out any vanilla, you won't need it) or even added to pumpkin bread. Replace rum and raisins as necessary. ENJOY!

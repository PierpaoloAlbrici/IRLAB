### Ingredients

 - 100 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 60 g of rice flour, white, unenriched

 - 25 g of sugars, granulated

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

 - 200 ml of water, bottled, generic

 - 200 g of beans, adzuki, mature seeds, raw

### Instructions

Put the ingredients in a bowl and mix well with a balloon whisk. Add hot water to Step 1 and mix well with your hands. If it is too sticky, moisten your hands with water. Do Steps 1 and 2 in a food processor and it will be easier. Transfer to a heatproof dish and cover with cling film. Heat in a 500 w microwave for 3.5 minutes. Put the mixture into a bread machine and knead for about 7 minutes. Otherwise, knead well with your moistened hands. When the mixture looks glossy, it is ready. Squeeze the mochi mixture with your hand and divide into 10 portions. Use a moistened plate so the mixture doesn't stick. Wrap the adzuki paste with the prepared mochi. Shape the mochi mixture into flat rounds and place the adzuki bean paste in the center. Fold the mochi mixture into half-moons like making gyoza. Moisten the plate beforehand and the mochi won't stick. They are ready to serve. They look glossy and thick. When you wrap them with kashiwa leaves, moisten the shiny sides of the leaves and wrap with mochi with the moistened side inside.

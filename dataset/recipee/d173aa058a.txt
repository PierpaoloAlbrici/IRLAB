Caramel Sauce from Scratch


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 3/4 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Combine the sugar and water in a medium-size heavy-bottomed saucepan (go with a larger size than needed, as the mixture bubbles up quite a bit when cooking). Heat pan over medium-low heat, continuously stirring until the sugar dissolves. Once sugar is dissolved, turn heat up to medium-high heat. Let the mixture boil without stirring at all. Allow the mixture to boil. If sugar sticks to the side of the pan, use a pastry brush to remove, but do not stir the mixture. Lower the temperature slightly and swirl the pan to mix. Continue to boil until mixture starts to turn a deep amber color. Be very careful not to burn it (if you under cook it, you can always put it back in a pan and cook it more until it thickens to the consistency you want). Once it turns this deep amber color, remove pot from the heat and immediately whisk in the cream, salt, vanilla and butter, being very careful not to splash. Stir until completely mixed and smooth. Allow the caramel to cool for about 10-20 minutes, then transfer into a storage dish (I used wide-mouth mason jars, which worked great). Notes: Makes about 1 1/2 cups. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator, for up to about a week.

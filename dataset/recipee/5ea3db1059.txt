Basic Baked Tofu


Ingredients


 - 28 ounce of tofu, raw, regular, prepared with calcium sulfate


 - 2 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Put oil onto a paper towel and wipe down a cookie sheet with rims with the oiled cloth. This should be just enough to coat the pan to prevent the tofu from sticking. Drain the tofu, then wrap and press gently with paper towels or a cloth towel to get out the excess liquid. Do not press too hard. Cut the blocks of tofu into 1/2 inch squares (or whatever shape you want). I usually cut 4 rows across and 4 down, then I take each piece and cut horizontally - almost like butterflying the cube, but slicing all the way through. Place on cookie sheet close together but not touching. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, turning pieces over halfway through cooking time.

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 5 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

 - 34 cup of cranberries, dried, sweetened

 - 2 teaspoon of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (195-200 degrees C). Mix with a whisk in a big bowl the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Cut in butter with a butter knife in each hand until mix looks like coarse crumbs. Pour in cream and fold in everything until just incorporated. Do NOT overmix. If mixture seems a little dry, add a little more cream. Fold currants or cranberries into batter. Press the dough in 3 or 4 batches on lightly floured board 1 1/4-inch (3cm) thick. Cut into triangles. All in all about 8-16 scones, depending on size (enough for 4 hungry mouths). Place scones on ungreased cookie parchment. Brush tops with a bit of cream. Bake for 15-20 minutes until golden brown. Let cool on a rack.

Apple Tarragon Granita


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 12 cup of spices, tarragon, dried


 - 3 cup of apple juice, canned or bottled, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid


 - 4 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

Place sugar and tarragon in a food processor and pulse until the tarragon is finely ground and the sugar is green; transfer to a medium bowl and whisk in apple juice and lemon juice. Let stand 10 minutes, stirring occasionally so that sugar dissolves completely. Pour mixture into a 9 inch square pan and place in freezer; stir, by pulling a fork through mixture, every 45 minutes until frozen, about 4 hours. Serve in chilled dishes.

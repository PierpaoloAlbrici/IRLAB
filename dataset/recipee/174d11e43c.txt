Chocolate Sauce


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 8 tablespoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


 - 6 teaspoon of sweetener, syrup, agave


Instructions: 

In a small saucepan, bring evaporated milk to a simmer. Pour 1/4 cup milk into a small bowl and stir in cocoa until it forms a smooth paste. Simmer rest of milk for 2-3 minutes to reduce and thicken slightly. Add cocoa paste and sweetener to milk in saucepan and stir over low heat until smooth. Chill, covered, in refrigerator for at least 1 hour ( if too thick, stir in a little more evaporated milk until it reaches desired consistency). Can be served hot, like hot fudge sauce, or at room temperature.

Kristen's Parmesan Roasted Potatoes


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 pound of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1/2 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, thyme, dried


Instructions: 

Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place the potatoes into a mixing bowl, and drizzle with olive oil. Sprinkle with kosher salt, black pepper, Parmesan cheese, and thyme leaves. Toss to evenly coat, and transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are golden brown on the edges and tender when pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Serve hot or at room temperature.

Creamy, Rich, and Decadent Cranberry Sauce


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of cranberries, dried, sweetened


 - 5 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 12 cup of cream, sour, cultured


Instructions: 

In a 4-quart saucepan, combine the cranberries, water and sugar. Bring to a boil over high heat, and continue boiling until thickened, about 30-35 minutes, stirring occasionally. Toward the end of the cooking time, use a potato masher to mash all of the berries. Reduce the heat to low and add the butter and salt; simmer until butter melts, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla. Cool to room temperature. Just before serving, fold in the sour cream and mix well.

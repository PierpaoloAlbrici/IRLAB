[8cd2fce560](http://www.food.com/recipe/best-chicken-wings-473302)

### Ingredients

 - 2 1/2-3 pound of chicken, broilers or fryers, wing, meat and skin, raw

 - 1 cup of sugars, brown

 - 12 cup of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry

 - 12 cup of catsup

 - 12 cup of vinegar, cider

 - 2 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 dash of spices, garlic powder

### Instructions

Mix sauce in a separate bowl. Arrange wings in baking pan so they are only 1 layer high. Pour Sauce over wings. Bake 400 degrees until brown and gummy. (Usually 1 to 1.5 hours). Spoon Sauce over wings after about 45 minutes (The longer you leave them in the oven, the gummier & stickier they are. I cook until the sauce no longer looks like juice).

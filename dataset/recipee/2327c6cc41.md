### Instructions

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Gently saute the garlic in 2 tablespoons butter for about 10 minutes until tender but not brown. Sift flour, baking powder and salt into a mixing bowl. Cut in 4 T butter until mixture is crumbly like cornmeal. Add parsley, dill, and milk, stir just until evenly moist. Pour into well-greased 8 x 8-inch pan.

For a variation, combine 1 cup of thinly sliced onions in with the garlic before you saute them.

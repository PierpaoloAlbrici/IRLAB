Honey Foot Soak


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of honey


 - 1 gallon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Mix 1-cup of honey to 1 gallon of warm water and soak for 10 to 15 minutes. Rinse your feet with tepid to cool water, dry and moisturize. Always be sure to dry your feet thoroughly (between toes) with a clean, cotton towel. Notes:. Honey is one of Nature's antiseptics with a silky, soothing quality.

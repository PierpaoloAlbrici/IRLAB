1) In a large bowl, stir together the egg substitute, bread crumbs, mayonnaise, thyme, garlic pwdr and pepper sauce. Minced the artichokes and add in to the mix along with the cheese and onions. Mix till well combined. 2. Spray an 8x8 baking pan. Spoon artichoke mix into the pan. 3. Bake in PREHEATED OVEN 350F for 25 to 30 min or possibly till bubbly and golden brown. Cold for 5 min, then cut into 16 two-inch squares; 2 per serving. Note:Prevention's estimate, 67 cals, 28% from fat (2g), 0.2g fiber, based on "reduced-fat Swiss cheese" and purchased seasoned bread crumbs. NOTES : BTW - Egg substitute does* NOT* bake well at temps higher than 350F. I add in moisture to the oven - spray the walls or possibly put a tin of water on a lower rack.

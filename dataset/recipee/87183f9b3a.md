[87183f9b3a](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/281723-pan-fried-polenta)

### Ingredients

 - 150 g of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 400 ml of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

In a small pot, heat cornmeal, water and salt until it comes to a simmer. Cook on low and stir often. After it begins to simmer, the cornmeal will soon absorb the water and turn into a thick, dough-like texture. Stir and "knead" it with a wooden spoon for 2-3 minutes until all water is absorbed and thick. Turn off heat. Cover with lid and let sit for 15 minutes. Lightly wet your hands and form the polenta into 8 patties. Heat a frying pan with 2 Tbsp oil and fry the patties (in batches if needed). Fry the first side until a little browned. Then flip over and fry the other side until nicely browned. Serve with cheese, soup or any thing wise that might be good with cornbread :)

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of nuts, hazelnuts or filberts

 - 1/4 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 5 tablespoon of sweetener, syrup, agave

 - 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 tablespoon of nuts, hazelnuts or filberts

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

### Instructions

Roast the hazelnuts at 350 degrees for 8-10 minutes until they darken a bit and smell fragrant. Transfer the hazelnuts to a towel and rub off the skins if you can (I didnt have a lot of luck with this). In a food processor, grind the hazelnuts to a smooth butter, about 5 minutes, scraping the sides as needed. Add the cocoa, agave, vanilla, oil and salt and process until well blended, about a minute. Store in a glass mason jar in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature prior to serving.

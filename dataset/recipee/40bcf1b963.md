### Instructions

In a large mug, combine cream, maple syrup, and cornstarch, stirring to combine. When the mixture is smooth, add the white chocolate chips. Microwave on high for 15 second increments (stirring between each increment) until the white chocolate chips have softened. Stir until smooth. Add the nutmeg and then stir in milk, a bit at a time, until the mug is as full as you like mine holds about a cup and a half. Microwave on high for 2 minutes or until its heated to your liking. Garnish with whipped cream and more nutmeg, if desired. NOTES: Ingredients are given for one large mug. If youre just making this for yourself or for you and a friend, the microwave is the way to go. If youre making a larger batch, you will probably want to do this on the stove. The basic instructions are the same, just combine the ingredients in an appropriately-sized pot instead of the individual mugs and be sure to whisk constantly.

### Ingredients

 - 1/4 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of onions, raw

 - 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 2 cup of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry

 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 1/2 cup of corn, sweet, white, raw

 - 1 pound of potatoes, raw, skin

 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1/2 cup of cheese, cheddar

### Instructions

1. Melt butter in large saucepan over medium to medium-high heat. Add onion and saute until softened, about 3-5 minutes. Add flour, garlic, and pepper. Stir constantly until mixture starts to lightly brown, only 1-2 minutes. 2. Stir in chicken broth and water. Make sure to stir well so there are no lumps of flour. 3. Stir in corn and hashbrowns. Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 5-10 minutes stirring occasionally. You want to simmer this just until everything is warmed through and soup has thickened. 4. Add in milk and grated cheese. Stir and continue to cook until cheese is melted. Serve immediately.

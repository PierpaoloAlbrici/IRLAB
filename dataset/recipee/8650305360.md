## Cool Blueberry Treat

[8650305360](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/desserts/cool-blueberry-treat/)

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 cup of blueberries, raw

 - 1 cup of syrup, maple, canadian

### Instructions

1. In a bowl, cover the raw cashews with water. Let them sit overnight, or if you are in a hurry, at least a couple of hours. 2. After soaking, drain cashews and place them in a high-powered blender. (I love my Vitamix and find this works nicely.) Add to this the blueberries and maple syrup. 3. Blend until creamy. Resist the urge to add water as this will ruin it. Rather, stop the blender from time to time and scrape down the sides. 4. Serve plain in a bowl or drizzle over berries. 5. Yummy and easy, peasy, lemon squeezy!

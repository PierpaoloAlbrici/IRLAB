Raspberry Jam


Ingredients


 - 18 ounce of raspberries, raw


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Stir together 3 cups raspberries and the sugar in a medium saucepan (off heat). Let stand 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until berries begin to give off their juices. Bring mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Skim off foam. Reduce heat; simmer, skimming foam occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in remaining raspberries; simmer just until berries break up, about 1 1/2 minutes. Let cool completely. Refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours, or up to 1 week.

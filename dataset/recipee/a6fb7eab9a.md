### Ingredients

 - 4 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 23 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 teaspoon of honey

 - 5 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 3 tablespoon of molasses

 - 23 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table

 - 13 cup of wheat germ, crude

 - 1 1/3 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 teaspoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 teaspoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 250F. Sprinkle yeast over 2/3 cup lukewarm water and add honey. The yeast should proof. Warm flour in a 250F oven for about 20 minutes. Combine molasses and 2/3 cup of lukewarm water and add to the yeast mixture. Stir this into the flour. Add salt, wheat germ, and 1 1/3 cups lukewarm water. The dough will be sticky. Butter a 9"x5" loaf pan and turn the dough into the pan. No kneading is necessary. (When I next make this, I'm planning to divide it into 2 loaf pans because I think smaller, non-mushroom-shaped loaves will be easier and less crumb-y to cut. But if you do this, don't bake it for 50 minutes. That's too long. I'll edit again once I figure that time out. ). Sprinkle sesame seeds over the top. Let rise to about 1/3 more. (45-60 minutes). Preheat oven to 375F. Bake for 50 minutes until crust is brown. Remove pan from oven and cool on rack for 10 minutes. Remove bread from pan and cool completely on rack.

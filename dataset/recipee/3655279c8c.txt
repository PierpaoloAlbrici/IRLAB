Instructions: 

To make the cakes, first preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine the brown rice and hazelnut flours, cocoa powder, brown sugar, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, combine the oil, maple syrup, vanilla, and water. Whisk the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Pour into 12 paper-lined 2 3/4-inch cupcake tins or 6 ungreased 5-inch rame-king. For cupcakes, bake for 30 minutes. For larger cakes, bake for 45 minutes, or until the cake bounces back after gently pressing a finger into the top. Let cool while you make the frosting. To make the frosting, in a double boiler or using a metal bowl placed on top of a pot of simmering water, melt the chocolate. When the chocolate is completely melted, transfer it to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the coconut oil, vanilla, salt, and cinnamon, and beat on medium speed to combine. Place the mixing bowl in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to chill the frosting. When cool, scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat again on high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Frost cooled cakes and devour!

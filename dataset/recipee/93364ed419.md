### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt

 - 3 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

 - 2 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 1/2 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 12 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

### Instructions

Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or brush with melted butter. Melt butter in a large sauce pan. Once the butter is melted, remove it from the heat and stir in the coconut and sugar. Form mixture into small balls with 1 or 2 almonds in the center of each. I use a heaping tablespoon of the mixture for each ball. Place chocolate coating in a small glass bowl and microwave on high in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until chocolate is melted and smooth. Dip each ball into the chocolate and coat evenly. Use a fork to lift the candies out of the melted chocolate and allow the excess chocolate to drip off. Place the candies on the cookie sheet and allow to cool completely.

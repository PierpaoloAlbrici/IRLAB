Kettle Corn


Ingredients


 - 3 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 14 cup of oil, safflower, salad or cooking, high oleic (primary safflower oil of commerce)


 - 1 cup of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)


 - 1 tablespoon of syrups, corn, light


Instructions: 

Process granulated sugar and salt in a mini food processor for 60- 90 seconds. Using a large heavy gauge pot with lid place on stove and preheat on medium high. Pour Safflower oil in pot and heat oil for about 1 minute. Pour corn into hot oil. Heat corn with oil for about 30 seconds; add corn syrup to hot oil and popcorn that has not yet popped. Stir corn mixture to mix corn syrup into the oil. Place lid on pot. The corn should be starting to pop shortly. Shake pot constantly while cooking. When the popcorn starts to pop and has a layer of popped corn covering the raw corn very quickly pour the salt and sugar mixture in to the popcorn that is popping. This needs to be timed right, and quickly done. A few kernels may fly out. A glass lid is a big help. During the cooking process you must be constantly shaking the pot. When the corn has slowed the process of popping, quickly remove the pot from the stove and pour into a large bowl. It's better if some has not popped so the rest will not burn with the sugar content.

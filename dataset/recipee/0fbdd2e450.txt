Oven-Baked Pepper Bacon


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 pound of bacon, meatless


 - 2 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Arrange bacon slices in 2 jelly-roll or roasting pans, overlapping the lean edge of each slice with the fat edge of the next. Evenly sprinkle pepper over bacon slices. Place pans on 2 oven racks and bake bacon 25 minutes, switching pans between upper and lower racks halfway through baking, until bacon is golden brown and crisp. Remove bacon to paper towels to drain; keep warm.

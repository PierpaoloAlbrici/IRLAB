Crazy Bread


Ingredients


 - 2 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 1/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

In a small bowl add the warm water, then the yeast. Let set until yeast dissolves, then add the sugar. Then add the flour and salt. Stir until the mixture is well incorporated. If needed, add some extra flour to get a good dough ball. Knead for five minutes (or use a KitchenAid Mixer). Place in a bowl that has been sprayed with cooking spray. Cover and let raise for 20 minutes. Heat oven to 450 degrees. Once the dough has raised, place onto a cookie sheet that has been sprayed with cooking spray. Flatten with hands. Using pizza cutter, cut into strips. Bake at 450 for 10-12 minutes until slightly brown. When done cooking, remove from oven. Let cool slightly. Spread top with melted butter or margarine. Then sprinkle with parmesan cheese and garlic salt. Or for sweet treats, use cinnamon/sugar mix and dip in frosting.

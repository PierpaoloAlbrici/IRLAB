Pistachio-Strawberry Ice Cream Cake Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 3/4 cup of cookies, vanilla wafers, lower fat


 - 2 cup of ice creams, strawberry


 - 2 cup of ice creams, vanilla


 - 2 cup of ice creams, vanilla


Instructions: 

Coat a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with butter and line it with plastic wrap, overlapping pieces as needed to completely cover the bottom and sides and leaving at least a 2-inch overhang. Mix the melted butter with the ground cookies until the cookies are thoroughly moistened, then press the mixture evenly into the bottom of the loaf pan. Let set up at least 5 minutes before proceeding. Evenly spread the strawberry ice cream on top of the ground cookies and put the loaf pan in the freezer until the ice cream is firm, at least 2 hours. Evenly spread the vanilla ice cream on top of the strawberry ice cream and return the pan to the freezer until the ice cream is firm, at least 2 hours. Top with the pistachio ice cream and cover with the plastic-wrap overhang. Put the pan back in the freezer until the ice cream is firm, at least 4 hours. To serve, unwrap the ice cream cake and pull it out of the loaf pan. Remove the plastic wrap and, using a knife dipped in hot water and wiped dry, slice into 1-inch slabs.

Homemade Ricotta Cheese


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 3 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

First, heat the whole milk, cream, and salt until it reaches 190 degrees F. Then, turn off the heat, and add the lemon juice. Stir once to incorporate the lemon juice, then allow the mixture to sit, undisturbed for 10 minutes. The acid is now fixing the milk. Next, pour the curdled mixture into a strainer lined with cheesecloth, set on a large bowl. Allow the liquid to drain, leaving behind ricotta cheese. After one hour, youll reach a sour cream mixture. I prefer leaving it for two hours for a firmer, cream cheese type spread. The related blog post also has step-by-step pictures, as well as two more recipes to use with your new cheese.

### Ingredients

 - 8 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 1 cup of cheese, cheddar

 - 3 tablespoon of cream, sour, cultured

 - 12 teaspoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

 - 1 dash of salt, table

 - 1 dash of spices, garlic powder

 - 1 dash of sauce, ready-to-serve, pepper, tabasco

### Instructions

Blend cheeses together. Add rest of ingredients. Chill at least 1 hour to blend flavors. Bring to room temperature before serving. Serve with crackers or veggies. NOTE: A food processor works well for this recipe- use it first to grate the cheddar, then to mix ingredients together. Cooking time is chilling time.

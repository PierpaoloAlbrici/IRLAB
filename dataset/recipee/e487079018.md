### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 tablespoon of seeds, sunflower seed kernels, dried

 - 2 tablespoon of seeds, flaxseed

 - 1 tablespoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

 - 2 tablespoon of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 220C (450F). In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, salt, and seeds. Cut in the coconut oil and butter to resemble coarse crumbs (a pastry blender can come in handy here, so can your hands). Add the buttermilk and mix until blended. Cut dough into 6 equal portions and arrange on a baking sheet. Bake at 220C for 12-15 minutes, until golden brown.

[98c6f4d633](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/grape-black-currant-granita.html)

### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of currants, zante, dried

 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 1/2 cup of grapes, red or green (european type, such as thompson seedless), raw

### Instructions

Combine the currant juice and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves, about 4 minutes. Transfer to an 8-inch-square stainless-steel or glass baking dish and let cool completely; stir in the grape juice. Freeze until ice crystals begin forming around the edges, about 45 minutes. Use a fork to scrape the crystals toward the center of the pan, then continue freezing, scraping every 30 minutes, until frozen, about 4 hours. Photograph by Levi Brown

Citrus Basil Sauce For Chicken Or Shrimp


Ingredients


 - 1/4 cup of orange juice, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, basil, dried


 - 3 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1/2 teaspoon of orange juice, raw


Instructions: 

Place the orange juice, lemon or lime juice, orange zest (if using), garlic, olive oil and basil in a small bowl or plastic container. Mix well. *This recipe makes about 2/3 cup of sauce. * **This recipe will cover about 1 1/2 pounds of shrimp or chicken. ** ***The chicken or shrimp should marinade in this sauce for ONLY 1 to 2 hours or the citrus will "cook" the proteins with the acids in the juices. It's not a huge issue, but it will alter the texture somewhat. ***

Bev's Own Stewed Apples


Ingredients


 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 7 cup of apples, raw, with skin


 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 12 cup of sugars, brown


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground


 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

In a 10" skillet (w/lid) melt butter over medium heat; turn off heat. Mix in sugar and brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and add 1/2 cup water, stirring to combine. Bring mixture to a boil and allow to boil until beginning to thicken. Reduce heat to medium; stir in apple slices, turning to coat. Cook over medium to medium high heat 4-5 minutes, stirring, allowing sauce to continue to thicken. Reduce heat to low, cover apples and cook until tender, stirring occasionally, another 5-10 minutes, adding more water if necessary, until apples are tender (cooking time will depend on the thickness of your apple slices). Sauce will thicken as it cools.

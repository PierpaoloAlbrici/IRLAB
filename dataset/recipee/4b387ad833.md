### Ingredients

 - 540 ml of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

 - 350 g of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

 - 100 ml of beans, adzuki, mature seeds, raw

 - 1 dash of salt, table

 - 1 dash of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

### Instructions

Put the adzuki beans and the water into a pan to heat. When it boils, remove the water immediately (to remove the scum). Add new water and simmer over low heat until the beans become soft. Add water a few times midway, and continue to simmer. When the beans become soft, drain in a colander or sieve. Do not discard the cooking water; let cool. Rinse the mochi rice with white rice and drain in a colander or sieve. Add the cooking water from the adzuki beans and the mixture of rice into a rice cooker. Add water a little over the 4 cup "okowa" (sticky rice) mark. Mix well, and let it soak for minimum 1 hour. Switch the rice cooker on the "okowa" setting. When done, mix to fluff the rice lightly with a spatula and to mix in the adzuki beans. (Transfer into an "ohitsu" [wooden rice container] if you have one. This will help to remove any excess water.) Dish it up, sprinkle with salt and black sesame seeds, and enjoy!

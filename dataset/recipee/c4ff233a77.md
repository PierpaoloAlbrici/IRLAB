### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of tofu, raw, regular, prepared with calcium sulfate

 - 1/4 cup of miso

 - 2 tablespoon of onions, raw

 - 3 tablespoon of carrots, raw

 - 3 tablespoon of seeds, sunflower seed kernels, dried

### Instructions

Press tofu to remove excess water: Place tofu on a flat surface. Cover with a cutting board, and place an iron skillet or a similarly heavy object on top. Allow it to sit for about 30 minutes. Crumble tofu into a medium bowl. Mix in miso and tahini. If desired, stir in onion, carrot, and seeds. Refrigerate.

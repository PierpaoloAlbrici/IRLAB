### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 8 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1 1/2 cup of cheese, cheddar

### Instructions

Preheat the broiler with the rack placed 5 to 6 inches below the heat source, and spray a large baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray. Spread the butter evenly over both sides of the cut bread, season with the garlic salt, and top with the cheddar cheese. Transfer the bread to the prepared baking sheet. Place under the broiler, and bake for 3 to 5 minutes, until cheese is melted and bread is toasted; watch carefully because the bread toasts quickly. Remove from the broiler, cut into slices, and serve warm.

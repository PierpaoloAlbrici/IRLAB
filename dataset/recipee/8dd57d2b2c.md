### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of potatoes, raw, skin

 - 12 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Place potatoes in a batter bowl. Add 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup milk or buttermilk and salt and pepper if you are using. Mix together to make a pouring consistency, like a sweet buttermilk-type pancake batter. You can adjust the milk and flour to make the pancake thicker or thinner to your preference. Melt the butter in a 8" frying pan (an omelet pan works nicely) over medium heat. Pour enough mixture just to cover the bottom of the pan. Cook for approximately 5 minutes, flip and cook for an additional 5 minutes for thinner pancakes. If you like a thicker pancake, cooking may take a minute or two longer per side. Remove from pan and place fillings in the center, roll up and keep heated while preparing the rest. This is a pretty traditional boxty, but you could add onion powder, garlic powder, or chopped chives to the batter. Makes 4 to 6 boxty, depending on how you make the batter.

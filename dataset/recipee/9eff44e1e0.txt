Fish Broth


Ingredients


 - 2 pound of sauce, fish, ready-to-serve


Instructions: 

Combine the fish and four cups of cold water in a five-quart casserole with a tightly fitting lid. Cook, covered, at 100 percent power in a 650- to 700-watt oven for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and uncover. If just the broth is required, strain through a fine sieve and discard the heads and bones. Store, covered, in the refrigerator for up to two days, or freeze. If proceeding with the soup, pass the broth with all the solids through a food mill with a medium blade. Discard the pulp and reserve the broth for the soup.

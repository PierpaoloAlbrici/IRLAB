### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 12 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

### Instructions

Melt white chocolate chips in a double-boiler, or by whatever method you prefer for melting chocolate. To do the double-boiler method without a real double-boiler, simply work with a mixing bowl above simmering water on stovetop. Find a small mixing bowl that balances well over a saucepan, so that the bottom of the bowl sits slightly down into the saucepan. Put some water in the saucepan, making sure it is not full enough to touch the bottom of the bowl. Put the saucepan on stovetop burner and bring the water to a simmer. Put white chocolate chips in the mixing bowl, above the saucepan of water. Stir them as they melt, until all lumps are gone. Add peanut butter to the mixing bowl. Stir well so that the peanut butter and white chocolate are thoroughly incorporated. Pour into a small pan. Let cool and harden several hours or overnight if possible, then cut into pieces.

Baby Broccoli (Steamed)


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of broccoli, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Wash the broccoli and remove any ugly pieces. Some stems may have started sprouting, they are o.k. Trim ends of stalks to make uniform in length. Split bunch into two groups and spread into a 9 x 13 glass baking dish alternating heads so they lay fairly flat. Pour 2 Tablespoons water into pan. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon Lemon Pepper. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoons salt. Cover with press and seal, poke several small holes across top. Microwave on high 3 to 5 minutes, to your desired texture. * To roast, lay on foil and place in 420 degree, preheated oven, for 8 minutes. Watch closely, all ovens cook different, adjust time as necessary.

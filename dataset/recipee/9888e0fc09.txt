Homemade Granola


Ingredients


 - 6 cup of oats


 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1/2 cup of honey


 - 1/4 cup of apple juice, canned or bottled, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid


 - 1/4 cup of molasses


 - 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 1/2 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt


 - 1 cup of wheat germ, crude


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 1/2 cup of seeds, sunflower seed kernels, dried


 - 1/4 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 1/4 cup of seeds, flaxseed


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a bowl, toss the oats with the oil, melted butter and salt. Spread the mixture out on 2 baking sheets and toast in the oven for 12 minutes, shaking the pans twice during the cooking time and making sure the oats don't burn. Set aside to cool a bit. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. In a medium saucepan, combine the brown sugar, honey, apple juice and molasses. Stir the mixture until combined, then heat over medium heat, stirring, until barely bubbling. Stir in the vanilla extract. Toss together the toasted oats, rice cereal, wheat germ, pecans, sunflower seeds, almonds and flax seeds. Pour in the sugar mixture, stirring as you pour. Toss to combine; it will be sticky! Thoroughly grease a baking sheet or line it with greased foil. Tip the mixture onto the baking sheet, spread out and bake until golden, about 30 minutes. Let cool, then use a fork to make clusters. Store in a jar until ready to use.

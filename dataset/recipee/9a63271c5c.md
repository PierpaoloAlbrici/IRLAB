### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of syrups, corn, light

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 3/4-1 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

 - 8-9 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt

 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

### Instructions

Bring the syrup and sugar to a boil in a sauce pan. Remove from heat and add peanut butter, mix well. In a large mixing bowl mix the syrup mixture and cereal together, starting with 8 cups of cereal and adding the additional cup if needed. Press mixture into a 9x13-inch pan. Melt chocolate chips together in a small saucepan on the stove or place the chips in a micro safe bowl, microwaving them on MED for about 2 minutes. Remove and stir until smooth. Spread the chocolate on top of squares. Let set at room temperature for a couple of hours, cut into squares and store at room temp in an air tight container. If stored in the fridge they will become VERY hard.

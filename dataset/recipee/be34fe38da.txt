Honey Roasted Pretzel Peanut Butter


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of honey


 - 1 tablespoon of honey


 - 1/2 cup of pretzels, soft, unsalted


Instructions: 

Note: If you have a small food processor (7- 12 cups), process in 2 batches. In a large food processor, add the nuts and process until smooth. You will have to scrape down the sides a few times. This process takes about 6 minutes. Then add honey and 1/4 cup pretzels. Process until drippy! This will take about another 3-5 minutes. Taste to make sure its sweet enough for you. Place in a bowl or jar and stir in remaining 1/4 cup of crushed pretzels. Place in a jar or sealed container and store in the cupboard or refrigerator.

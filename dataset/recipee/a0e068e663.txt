Raspberry Rose Sundaes


Ingredients


 - 12 ounce of raspberries, raw


 - 13 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 13 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 1 tablespoon of alcoholic beverage, distilled, vodka, 80 proof


 - 1 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 3 tablespoon of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

In a food processor, add all of the raspberries, but reserve a small handful for garnish. Puree for 1 minute. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the sugar and water. Microwave on high for 1 minute, stop and stir, and then microwave for an additional minute. The sugar should dissolve completely. Next, while the food processor is running, slowly stream in the sugar-water mixture. Continue to process until everything is smooth. Its impossible to over-process this mixture. Next, strain the raspberry mixture into a bowl, and discard any seeds. Into the bowl with the raspberry puree, stir 1 cup of the heavy cream, the vodka, and the rose water. Cover the bowl and chill for at least 4 hours. Once the ice cream mixture is cold, set up the ice cream maker. Freeze the raspberry mixture according to the manufacturers instructions. Ice cream churning time will vary, but when the mixture looks like creamy soft serve, its done. Before turning off the ice cream maker, stir in the last handful of raspberries. Churn until the berries are fully incorporated. Scrape the mixture into a freezer-safe bowl, cover, and freeze until firm, about 4 hours or overnight. Before serving, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of heavy cream in a small bowl in the microwave for about 30 seconds. Once steaming with small bubbles around the edge, remove it from the microwave and add the chocolate chips. Let it sit for about 45 seconds, and then stir until the chocolate melts and forms a smooth sauce. To serve, scoop the ice cream into a bowl and top with the warm chocolate sauce. Top with additional raspberries, if desired. I also love to serve this raspberry rose ice cream in a flute topped with champagne. Try it! Yield: about 3 cups of ice cream.

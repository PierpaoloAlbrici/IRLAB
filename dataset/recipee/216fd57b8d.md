### Ingredients

 - 34 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 34 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Grease a baking sheet. In a large bowl, stir together both flours, the sugar, baking powder, and salt. Using a fork, gradually stir in the cream until a soft dough is formed. On a lightly floured board, knead the dough 10 to 12 times. Re-flour the board and pat into a circle or rectangle 1/2 inch thick. Using a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter, cut into biscuits (or just cut into 2 1/2-inch squares). Place on prepared baking sheet and bake 15 to 18 minutes or until golden on top. Variation: Add 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg to the dry ingredients.

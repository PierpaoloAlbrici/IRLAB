Sherby's Cornmeal Fried Okra


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of okra, raw


 - 2 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow


 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Mix your cornmeal and salt well in a gallon sized Ziploc bag. Add okra, about 1 1/2 cups at a time. Close bag and shake to cover okra completely with cornmeal mixture. Fry in a cast iron skillet in vegetable or corn oil (I like corn oil best) until okra floats and turns a light brown. Watch this carefully as once it begins to brown, it does so very quickly. Repeat process until all okra is fried.

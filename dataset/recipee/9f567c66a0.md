 - 13 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

### Instructions

Add all ingredients to a large bowl in the order listed, adding nut butter and honey/maple syrup last. Mix well (I use my hands) and roll into bite size balls. Coat bites with extra vanilla protein or coconut. Freeze or keep in refrigerator to maintain freshness. (I usually coat them after they have set in freezer for at least 510 minutes. Then return to freezer after.)

[4fa00d9afe](http://www.food.com/recipe/georgenes-very-high-protein-sugar-free-pancakes-318577)

### Ingredients

 - 14 cup of cheese, cottage, creamed, large or small curd

 - 1/4-1/2 cup of egg substitute, powder

 - 1 scoop of beverages, protein powder whey based

 - 12 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 14 cup of sweetener, syrup, agave

### Instructions

Throw all the ingredients into a small blender for one serving, and blend until thickened. If you choose to make more than two servings, use a normal-sized blender. Cook, turning carefully only once, on a hot griddle sprayed with vegetable spray. Be sure the first side is completely done (bubbles forming in top of pancake) before turning. Remove pancakes to plate when cooked, and top with sugar free maple syrup, low carb fruit, or sugar free jam. Or, spread them lightly with softened low-fat cream cheese. These are so delicious, they are even good raw! And using EggBeaters or other egg substitute, it's safe to eat the raw batter!

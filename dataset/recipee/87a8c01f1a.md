### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 78 ounce of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 4 ounce of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

### Instructions

Place the flour, yeast, salt, water and olive oil in a large bowl and blend together with a wooden spoon. When the dough begins to form, place it on a lightly floured surface and knead for about 3-5 minutes. The dough will become smooth and pliable. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and let it rest for 1 hour. Place the sesame seeds in a large bowl and pour about 1 Tablespoon of warm water over them just to dampen them. Mix them around with your fingers a bit and let them sit. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Rub your hands with a bit of olive oil and remove the dough, coating gently with the olive oil from your hands. Place the dough into the dampened seeds and turn to cover completely. Place the dough on the baking sheet and let it rest for 1 more hour. Preheat your oven to 425 degrees F. Using a knife, place a cut around the middle of the ball of dough and then 2 slits on the top of the dough. Bake this for about 30 minutes or until golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.

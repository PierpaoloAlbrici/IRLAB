### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of cherries, sweet, raw

 - 3 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 2 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

### Instructions

Set aside 6 whole cherries, with stems if still attached. Pit the remaining cherries. Combine the pitted cherries and one tablespoon of the confectioner's sugar in a food processor. Puree until coarsely chopped. Whip the cream with the remaining confectioner's sugar until medium peaks form. Fold in the cherry puree and distribute the mouse among champagne flutes or small parfait glasses. Top with reserved cherries and serve immediately. The longer the mousse sits the darker the color.

Thin Pizza Crust


Ingredients


 - 2 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 14 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 34 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar into the warm water. Sprinkle the yeast on top of the water and let it rehydrate for about 5-8 minutes. Meanwhile, in a medium sized mixing bowl, mix the flour and salt. Stir the yeast in the water until dissolved, then pour the yeast mixture into the flour mixture and blend. Pour out the dough onto the counter top and knead for about two or three minutes. Roll the crust out so it's about 12-14" in diameter (I roll mine out to about 1/4" thick) then poke it full of holes with a fork. Pre-bake the crust in the preheated oven on a pizza stone for four minutes. This gets the crust crispy all the way through (if you don't have a pizza stone, you can just use a pizza pan, though your crust won't be as crispy). With your pizza paddle, pull the crust out of the oven (or the whole pan if you're using a pan) and load it up with your sauce, veggies, cheese, whatever. Stick the pizza back in the oven for 8 more minutes. Let it cool for about 2 minutes, then enjoy.

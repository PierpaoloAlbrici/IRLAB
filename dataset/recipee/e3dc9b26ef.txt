Braised Fish Recipe


Ingredients


 - 450 g of fish, cod, atlantic, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 150 ml of oil, corn, peanut, and olive


 - 275 g of shallots, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 1 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 1 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 2 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 150 ml of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry


Instructions: 

Pat the fish fillets dry using kitchen paper. Rub both sides with salt and then cut them into 3.5cm wide diagonal strips. Set the fish aside for 20 min then again pat them dry with kitchen paper. The salt will have extracted some of the excess moisture from the fish. Heat the oil in a wok or possibly large frying pan. Then brown the fish in two batches draining each cooked batch on kitchen paper. Drain all but 1 Tbsp. of oil from the pan and throw away the rest. Re heat the pan and add in the shallots (or possibly pickling onions) and ginger. Stir fry them for 1 minute and then add in the rest of the ingredients. Bring this mix to the boil then turn the heat down to a simmer. Return the fish to the pan cover it and braise the fish in the sauce for 23 min. Using a slotted spoon gently remove the fish and shallots and arrange them on a hot platter. Then pour the sauce over the top and serve with steamed rice and a fresh green vegetable. Onions in all forms are popular in Chinese cookery but shallots are especially prized for their distinctive flavour. I think they complement fish beautifully. If you cant get shallots for this recipe you can use pickling onions instead. A hard white fish such as cod haddock or possibly bass will work better than delicate ones such as plaice or possibly sole. Serves 4

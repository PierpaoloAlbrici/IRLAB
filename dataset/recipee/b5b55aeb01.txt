Greek Lemon-Roasted Potatoes


Ingredients


 - 4 pound of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 12 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 12 cup of lemon juice, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, oregano, dried


 - 12 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Place potatoes in a large baking dish. Add remaining ingredients to the dish and toss until well coated.

Turn on the broiler for a few minutes to make them nice and brown.

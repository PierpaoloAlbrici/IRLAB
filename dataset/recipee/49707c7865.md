### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 3 pint of ice creams, vanilla

### Instructions

In a saucepan over medium-high heat, add water and sugar. Stir occasionally for approximately 5 minutes, or until sugar melts and turns a golden brown. (Keep a watchful eye on sugar because it will go from being golden brown to burning in about 1 minute). Immediately remove from heat and whisk in cream. Stir constantly until smooth. At this point, caramel sauce will be very thin. After it cools, it will thicken to the consistency of, well...caramel sauce. Note: when adding and stirring cream, wear an oven mitt on your stirring hand. The heat of the sugar will cause a tremendous amount of scalding steam when it comes into contact with the cream.

### Ingredients

 - 1 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, coriander seed

### Instructions

In a bowl, soak the corriander seeds in water, overnight, and keep aside. The next morning, discard the corriander seeds. Use the water to guargle. Let it reach well inside your throat and after guargling with it, throw it out of your mouth. Do this as soon as you wake up, before brushing your teeth. Within a few hours, you will feel much better than what any allopathic tablets would have made you feel. May the Goddess heal you back to good health and vitality!

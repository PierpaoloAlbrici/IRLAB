### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of sweet potato, raw, unprepared

 - 1 cup of apples, raw, with skin

 - 1 cup of fresh red onions, upc: 888670013229

 - 1 tablespoon of syrup, maple, canadian

 - 2 teaspoon of pumpkin, raw

 - 1/2 cup of cranberries, dried, sweetened

 - 1/2 cup of nuts, walnuts, english

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/4 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 425 F. Grease a 13x9 baking dish with coconut oil, just like you would for a cake. Mix together all of the ingredients in a large bowl, then transfer the mixture to your baking dish. Bake for about an hour, or until a fork pierces the potatoes easily. Check it after 45 minutes, because the time really depends on how small you chop the potatoes. Enjoy! I think real, whole, unprocessed foods taste better than packaged ones! This recipe uses fresh ingredients, that are packed with nutrients and flavors. Itll blow away your guests!

Olive Oil Flatbread (Matzo - Passover Bread)


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 13 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Add flour, salt and olive oil in a food processor. Once it is on, pour in 1/2 cup water. Go on running processor until dough forms a firm ball, rides around on blade and is not at all sticky. (If you prefer, whisk together the water and oil and add this to machine all at once.) Cut dough into 12 small balls this is easiest if you cut the ball in half, then half again, then into thirds and flatten each into a 3- to 4-inch patty. On a well-floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll each patty into a 6 to 8 inch circle. The shapes can be irregular, but dough should be so thin you can almost see through it. Place dough on ungreased cookie sheets, sprinkle with sea salt if desired. You may find using a silicone baking mat helpful. Prick thoroughly and completely all over with a fork to prevent any puffing up. Bake for about 2 to 3 minutes, keeping a very close eye on breads they can burn very quickly. Once they begin to brown, flip and cook for another minute or so on the other side. Repeat with all the remaining dough and allow to cool completely on a wire rack.

Simple Vegan Blueberry Pancakes


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1 cup of soymilk, original and vanilla, unfortified


 - 13 cup of blueberries, raw


Instructions: 

Mix together flour, baking powder and cinnamon. Add soy milk and blueberries and stir gently until "just mixed". If the batter is too thick or runny, add more soy milk or flour accordingly. It should be a "pancakey" consistency. Pour batter in small amounts to a warm, un-oiled, non-stick frying pan on medium heat. When edges start to pull away from the bottom of the pan and a few bubbles form on the tops, lift up a little and check to see if the pancake is turning a light golden brown. When they are, flip the pancakes over. After a few minutes, carefully make a little slit in one to see if it is cooked all the way through, and check that the second side has become a light golden brown colour. Serve hot and enjoy!

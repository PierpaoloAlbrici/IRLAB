### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of goji berries, dried

 - 1/2 cup of apple juice, canned or bottled, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid

 - 2 teaspoon of cornstarch

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

Wash the berries well. Use small berries such as blueberries or raspberries whole; remove hulls and chop strawberries into approximately 1/2-inch chunks. Combine the berries in a medium-size saucepan with the apple juice. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook gently until all the berries have softened and burst, 5 to 10 minutes. Dissolve the cornstarch in 1/4 cup cold water. Stir slowly into the berry mixture and simmer until it has thickened, about 1 minute. If youd like the sauce to be sweeter, stir in the optional brown sugar to taste. Let cool to room temperature before serving.

### Ingredients

 - 3 1/2 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 2 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1/2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 3/4 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

### Instructions

Pour the powdered sugar into the bowl of your stand mixer (or into any other big bowl). Just keep it there for a while, it will patiently wait. Melt butter in saucepan over medium-high heat. Add in brown sugar and milk; stir to combine. Bring to a boil. Boil for 2 minutes. (Stirring for, yes, the whole 2 minutes.) Remove from heat and stir in the peanut butter & vanilla extract. Now! Time to re-visit the lonely powdered sugar! Pour the hot, peanut butter mixture over the powdered sugar. Beat until smooth. (It wont take long, especially if you have a stand mixer.) Pour into an 8x8 dish and stick it in the fridge for about 5 minutes to firm it up. Try to resist the urge to eat the scraps left in the bowl and on the beaterits still quite hot! Let it cool, then eat the scraps. Once the fudge is all nice and firm, its ready to eat! Just cut it up into chunks. I actually kinda like it cold, straight from the fridge, but you can let it sit on the counter for a few minutes if you like.

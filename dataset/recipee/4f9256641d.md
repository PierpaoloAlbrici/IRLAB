### Ingredients

 - 6 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw

 - 24 ounce of salad dressing, italian dressing, commercial, regular

 - 3 cup of sauce, barbecue

### Instructions

Put two whole chickens in a gallon zip lock bag with a 24 oz. bottle of Italian Salad Dressing. Seal the bag and refrigerate overnight. Remove from bag and pat dry. Sprinkle the spice over the chicken inside and out. Place chicken in the smoker and cook for 5 hours or until done. Every hour brush on a lemon mop ( see recipe). If you are grilling the chicken, brush on more often. At the four hour mark brush the BBQ sauce over the chicken, repeat every 30 minutes until chicken is done. This recipe works well with chicken halves or chicken breasts. Also you can grill the chicken pieces.

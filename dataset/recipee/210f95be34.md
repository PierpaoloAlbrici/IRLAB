### Ingredients

 - 13 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 13 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 14 cup of vital wheat gluten

 - 3 tablespoon of wheat germ, crude

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Mix dry ingredients together, then mix in butter until you have a coarse meal. Add water and continue mixing until dough comes together. Wrap in plastic and freeze for 15 minutes. Roll dough in between two sheets of wax paper (to avoid adding extra flour). Press into 9 inch pie plate. Freeze for another 15 minutes. Use in your recipe, or for a prebaked crust, prick the botom with a fork. Cover the crust with foil and pile dried beans on top, to keep the foil right on the crust. Bake at 400 for 16 minutes. Remove the beans, re-cover with the foil (loosely this time) and bake another 5 minutes.

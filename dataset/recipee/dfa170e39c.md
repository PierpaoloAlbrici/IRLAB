 - 1 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cloves, ground

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400. Lightly butter a 9-by-4-inch loaf pan. In a small saucepan, combine the honey, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, saffron and 3/4 cup of water and bring to a simmer, whisking until the mixture is smooth. Remove from the heat and let stand for 15 minutes. In a large bowl, whisk the 3 flours with the baking powder, baking soda and melted butter. Add the honey mixture and whisk until smooth. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 30 minutes, until the loaf is deeply browned and a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Transfer the loaf to a rack and let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Unmold and serve.

Duck Sauce


Ingredients


 - 5 cup of plums, raw


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 3/4 cup of apple juice, canned or bottled, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid


 - 1 teaspoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 1 tablespoon of apricots, dried, sulfured, uncooked


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 1/2 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


Instructions: 

Place fruit in a stock pot over medium high heat. Add water, apple juice, soy sauce, apricot preserves, brown sugar, garlic powder, and dry mustard. Bring to a simmer, stirring frequently to dissolve brown sugar. Reduce heat, and continue simmering for 40 minutes, or until fruit is completely soft. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Blend sauce in a food processor or blender until completely smooth, adjusting consistency with additional water, if desired. Cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.

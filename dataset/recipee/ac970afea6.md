### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 12 ounce of alcoholic beverage, beer, regular, all

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F. Mix all ingredients except melted butter together-stirring just until blended. Pour into greased bread loaf pan. Spread melted butter over the top of the bread during the last 10 minutes of baking. Bake at 350F for 1 hour. Perhaps those who have complained that the bread is not the right consistancy have not been spooning the flour into their measuring cups or have been over stirring the batter?

Simple Everything Chicken Tenders


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw


 - 1 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular


 - 5 ounce of cookies, graham crackers, plain or honey, lowfat


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 400 degree's Fahrenheit. Prepare a cookie sheet by covering with foil and spraying with cooking spray (e.g. Pam). Crush crackers into crumbs (I use the pulse setting in my blender to crush the crackers to a bread crumb consistency). Makes about 2 cups of crushed crackers. Place mayonnaise in one bowl. Place crushed crackers in another bowl. Dip chicken tender in mayonnaise (covering with thin layer of mayonnaise), and then dip chicken in crackers until covered with crackers. Place chicken in prepared cookie sheet. Repeat process for all chicken tenders. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until chicken is cooked.

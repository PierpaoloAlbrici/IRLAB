Seasonal Apricot Jam


Ingredients


 - 500 g of apricots, dried, sulfured, uncooked


 - 150 g of sugars, brown


Instructions: 

Wash the apricots, cut in half, and remove the pits. Cut into pieces, add sugar (30% of the apricots' weight), and lightly mix. Simmer for about 2-3 hours until the sugar is melted, and the liquid comes out from the apricots. Simmer until it gets thickened while skimming off the scum.

### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of lard

 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

In a large bowl combine flour, sugar and salt. Put milk and lard in pan heat to scalding point. When it begins to bubble pour all milk over the flour mixture. Keep stirring until all flour has been mixed into the milk. Let cool. Pinch off walnut size portions and roll THIN. About the size of a dinner plate. Bake on lefse iron or large griddle. Watch carefully, so not to burn them, it only takes a minute for this step. When you see the lefse start to bubble and turn a light brown, flip and bake the other side. Lay it on top of waxed paper and keep stacking them up. Keep a piece if waxed paper on top to keep them from drying out. Store in airtight container or freeze. Butter and sprinkles lightly with sugar, roll up and eat. If needed when you're ready to eat place lefse between damp dishtowels to soften, about 15 minutes.

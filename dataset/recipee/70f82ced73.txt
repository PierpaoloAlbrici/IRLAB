Carolina Pulled Pork


Ingredients


 - 3-4 pound of pork, fresh, loin, tenderloin, separable lean only, raw


 - 3 cup of vinegar, cider


 - 2 cup of beverages, carbonated, ginger ale


 - 34 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


Instructions: 

Add vinegar, ginger ale, brown sugar, pepper, salt and mustard to the crock pot. Stir to combine. Add pork to the crock pot. Set crock pot on high until the liquid starts to bubble. Lower crock pot to low and cook for 8-10 hours until the internal temp is 190 or the pork easily falls apart. Take the pork out of the crock pot and set aside. Strain the liquid and set aside. Let the liquid separate. Spoon out the grease off the top. When the pork cools a bit, pull the pork apart by hand. Add liquid back to the pulled pork as needed to keep the pork moist.

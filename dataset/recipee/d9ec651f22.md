[d9ec651f22](http://www.food.com/recipe/blue-cheese-dressing-321128)

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of cream, sour, cultured

 - 1 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular

 - 6-8 ounce of cheese, blue

 - 1 tablespoon of vinegar, distilled

### Instructions

Combine all the ingredients in bowl. Using a whisk, blend ingredients together - do not use a food processor as this will rob you of that wonderful chunky blue cheese texture. Refrigerate at least one hour before serving. Note: I recommend using Gorgonzola which is a reasonably priced, easily obtainable ivory colored Italian cheese with blue-green veins, made from whole cow's milk. I buy the 7 ounce wedges which have a buttery texture and crumble it into the mixture by hand (messy but good).

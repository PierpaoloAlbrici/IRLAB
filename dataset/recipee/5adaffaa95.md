### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1/2 cup of vinegar, distilled

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, poppy seed

 - 2 pound of spinach, raw

 - 4 pound of strawberries, raw

### Instructions

Mix the oil, vinegar, and sugar in a food processor until smooth. Stir in poppyseeds. Wash and dry spinach leaves. Refrigerate for 2 or more hours until crisp again. Toss the spinach and sliced strawberries together with the dressing. This salad is beautiful and delicious. Note: as a substitute for strawberries, I have made this salad using a can of Mandarin oranges, drained.

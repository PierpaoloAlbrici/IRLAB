Apple Butter


Ingredients


 - 4 pound of apples, raw, with skin


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cloves, ground


 - 2 quart of apples, raw, with skin


Instructions: 

Place the apples in a 3- or 4-quart noncorrodible pot. Stir in the sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and apple cider. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Cook, uncovered, for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn down the heat to very low and cover the pot. Continue to cook for 3 hours, until a deep brown color. Uncover the pot and continue cooking the apple butter until the liquid is cooked off and the apple butter is thick. Allow to cool for several hours at room temperature. Spoon the apple butter into jars and cover with a lid.

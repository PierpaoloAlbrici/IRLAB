### Ingredients

 - 3 1/3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2/3 cup of sugars, brown

 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cloves, ground

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground

 - 2/3 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 2 cup of pumpkin, raw

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 325F. Spray one large loaf pan, about 9" x 5", with cooking spray. In a large bowl, mix together first seven ingredients. In another bowl, blend the remaining ingredients together. Combine all ingredients and stir well until smooth. (It is a thick batter!) Spoon into loaf pan and lightly smooth out the top with a spatula. Bake about 1 hours and 15 minutes, or until cake tester comes out dry and clean. Cool thoroughly. It'll seem like the loaf doesn't want to come out. Just give it a few good slaps on the bottom of the pan, and it'll come right out. Great to bake ahead and freeze. Wrap in plastic, then foil. Defrost at room temperature. If you'd like to make three large loaves, triple the ingredients, use a 29 ounce can of pumpkin puree, and mix in a great big bowl. Bake for 1 1/2 hours. This full recipe can make 7 mini loaves (3" x 6" mini loaf pans). Bake the mini loaves for an hour.

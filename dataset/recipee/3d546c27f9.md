Using a potato masher, forks, or even a blender, mash up your raspberries as much as possible. Combine with lemon juice and stir well. Pour mixture through a sieve to strain out raspberry seeds and any pulp you dont want. Discard seeds and pulp. Add 2 cups of water to the lemon & raspberry juice. Stir and taste. Add additional water or sugar as necessary to temper the tartness. Chill till ready to serve

### Ingredients

 - 1 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 3 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table

 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

Add water, yeast and sugar in mixing bowl, allow to bubble (about 4 min). Add salt and flour slowly, checking for consistency. You may need to use as much as 1/2 a cup extra flour- dough should be firm but slightly sticky. Place in greased bowl and allow to double (15-30 minutes). Flour your hands and separate into 12 rolls on greased pan. Allow to rise 15 minutes more. Bake at 350F for 15 minutes.

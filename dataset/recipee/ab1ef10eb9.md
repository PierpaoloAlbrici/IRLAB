### Ingredients

 - 3 1/2 cup of corn, sweet, white, raw

 - 1 1/2 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Mix Masa and water until it turns to a dough consistency. Roll a golf size ball and pat it until its like a pancake. (Optional --> on a griddle place the dough and heat it up until its lightly cooked) Pinch the edges of the sope all around it. Heat oil on a small or medium pan...once its hot place your Sope and fry it until it turns light golden Top your sole with anything you like and enjoy! ! My version: Fried beans at the bottom then I begin topping it with: shredded beef, shredded lettuce, guacamole, queso freso,sour cream, salsa, and Mexican Pickled onions(cebollas curtidas) and as a side Mexican Rice! !

### Ingredients

 - 1/4 cup of vinegar, balsamic

 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 2 tablespoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

I used a jar to combine the ingredients in. Add everything into a jar. Put the lid on it and shake, shake, shake. Serve over salad or use as a marinade for chicken. If you use it as a marinade, it will easily marinate 4 good sized chicken breasts.

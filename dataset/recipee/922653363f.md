### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw

 - 34 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 4 cup of denny's, hash browns

 - 24 ounce of carrots, raw

### Instructions

Heat grill. Cut 4 (18x12 inch) sheets of heavy-duty foil; spray center of each with cooking spray. In large bowl, mix ground beef, seasoned salt and pepper. Shape mixture into 4 patties, 1/2 inch thick. In center of each sheet of foil, place 1 cup potatoes, 1/2 of the vegetables and cheese sauce chips, and 1 beef patty. Wrap each packet securely using double fold seals, allowing room for heat expansion. Place packets, sealed side down, on grill; cover. Cook with medium heat 10 minutes. Turn packets over; cook covered 15 to 18 minutes longer or until thermometer inserted in center of patties reads 160 degrees and vegetables are tender. To serve, carefully open packets to allow steam to escape. Stir to mix in cheese sauce.

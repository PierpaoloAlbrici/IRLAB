### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 cup of carrots, raw

 - 14 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 12 cup of marmalade, orange

 - 1 tablespoon of cornstarch

### Instructions

Heat a non-stick skillet over med. heat. Add chicken and spinkle with salt and pepper. (I don't use salt and pepper, instead I use Nature's Seasonings, personal preference) Cook 6 - 8 minutes, turning once, until brown. Remove chicken from skillet, keep warm. In same skillet, add sugar snap peas*, carrots and water. Increase heat to med. high, cover and cook 4 - 6 minutes or until crisp-tender. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix marmalade and cornstarch until well blended. Return chicken to skillet and add marmalade mix. Cooke 2 - 3 minutes longer, stirring constantly, until chicken is no longer pink in center and the sauce has thickened. *I couldn't find sugar snap peas so I used Italian green beans, it was good!

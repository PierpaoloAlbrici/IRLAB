[8a112718d2](https://recipeland.com/recipe/v/bulls-eye-bbq-sauce-50996)

### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of onions, raw

 - 8 ounce of tomato sauce, canned, no salt added

 - 1 cup of alcoholic beverage, beer, regular, all

 - 1 1/4 cup of catsup

 - 2 teaspoon of sugars, brown

 - 2 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 1 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 teaspoon of sauce, worcestershire

 - 1 dash of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

### Instructions

Combine ingredients, cover and simmer for 45 minutes. If you taste the sauce before simmering, it will not taste as good as when the flavors have melded, but after cooking it is great. Just like the 'real' sauce on barbecued pork steaks. For the original, do not use beer.

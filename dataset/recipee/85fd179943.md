First, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F, for rib cooking. Next, in a bowl, blend the parsley, garlic, oil, salt and pepper together well to incorporate. To prepare the beef, trim the fingers from the bottom of the beef and the tail of the rib, retaining the center rib section. Then evenly apply the rub to the entire rib.

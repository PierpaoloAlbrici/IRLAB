Instructions: 

In a large saucepan, bring water to a boil. When it comes to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. Heat oil in large pot over medium-high heat, until a piece of onion sizzles when added. Add garlic, peppers and onions to oil. Stir veggies; turn heat down to medium when onions start to brown around the edges. Add tomatoes, stirring until heated through. Add all seasonings and continue to stir over medium heat until veggies are evenly coated. While cooking the vegetables, rinse the rice 3 times, until the water runs clear. Add rinsed rice to veggies, stirring for approximately 1 minute, coating rice with the seasoned veggie mix. Pour in hot water and stir well, making sure to scrape any rice off the bottom and sides of the pot. Let rice come to a boil and partly dry out. Watch for when holes or pockets appear on rice, lower heat to lowest setting and then cover with lid. Keep covered for 25 minutes - do NOT remove lid. Uncover, stir rice and serve.

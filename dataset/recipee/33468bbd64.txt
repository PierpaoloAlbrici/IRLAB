Coriander Coated Salmon


Ingredients


 - 36 ounce of fish, salmon, atlantic, wild, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 14 cup of spices, coriander seed


 - 2 teaspoon of corn, sweet, white, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of orange juice, raw


 - 3 tablespoon of parsley, fresh


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, brown


Instructions: 

Mix the orange peel and parsley (and a chopped clove of garlic if you like it) in a bowl and chill. Mix the corander, pepper and brown sugar in another bowl. Sprinkle the salmon with a little salt. Coat salmon on all sides with the spice mixture. Melt 1/2 Tbsp butter and 1/2 Tbsp oil in a heavy large skillet over med-high heat. Add 3 salmon fillets. Cook fish until the crust is golden and center is opaque, about 4 minutes per side. (I like salmon on the rare side, so cook only 3 minutes if you do too). Transfer to a platter, tent with foil to keep warm. Wipe skillet, and then repeat with remaining butter, oil and salmon. When all the salmon is done, spoon the fresh parsley mix on top and serve.

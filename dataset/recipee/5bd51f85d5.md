### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of beverages, almond milk, unsweetened, shelf stable

 - 1 teaspoon of vinegar, cider

 - 34 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 13 cup of oil, canola

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 13 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 34 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Review recipe and gather ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line muffin pan with paper liners or use silicon liners with a sheet pan. Combine the nondairy milk and apple cider in a large bowl until foamy. Set aside. In a medium bowl, sift together dry ingredients (flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt). Set aside. Add the rest of the wet ingredients to the milk/cider mixture (sugar, canola oil and extract). In several batches, add the dry mixture to the wet mixture and mix very well. Using an ice cream scoop or a small ladle, scoop batter into prepared pan or silicon cups. Bake for about 18 minutes, until cake springs back to touch. Cool completely on a cake rack before frosting.

Pre-heat oven to 375F. Boil noodles until al dente (still firm in the middle), and drain well. In a large bowl, mix noodles with cheeses, cream, garlic, salt, and pepper. Place into individual casserole pans so that mixture is about 1 1/2" deep. Sprinkle with more mozzarella, then more romano. Bake until golden brown (10-15 minutes).

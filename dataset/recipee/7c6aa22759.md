### Ingredients

 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 13 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 tablespoon of vinegar, cider

 - 12 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, powdered

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 190 C / 375F. Grease and flour a 20 cm cake tin. Combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt. Make a well in the centre of the mixture, and add the vanilla essence, vinegar and oil, then gradually stir in the water. Continue stirring until thoroughly blended, but do not over-mix. Pour all of the batter into the cake tin, and bake, uncovered, for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the centre of the cake, comes out clean. Do not over bake, the secret to this cake is its moistness. Cool in the tin on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then transfer the cake from the tin to the rack, to cool completely. Sift the icing sugar over the top, and serve.

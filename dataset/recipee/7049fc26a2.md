### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 34 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow

 - 14 cup of sweetener, syrup, agave

 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 1/2 cup of corn, sweet, white, raw

 - 34 cup of egg substitute, powder

 - 34 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Combine flour, cornmeal, Splenda, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Mix well and set aside. In a separate medium bowl, mix together corn, egg substitute, and yogurt. Whisk thoroughly. Add contents of the medium bowl to the large one, and stir until completely mixed. Line 9 cups of a 12-cup muffin pan with baking cups and/or spray with nonstick spray. Evenly distribute batter among the 9 cups -- cups will be VERY full. (We don't call 'em MegaMuffins for nothin'! ). Bake in the oven for 15 - 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. Allow to cool and then enjoy!

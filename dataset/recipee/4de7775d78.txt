Burnt Butter Rice Recipe


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry


 - 2 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

1. Place the chicken broth and rice in a large pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 15 min. 2. During the last 5 min of the rice, heat the butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat till it browns and the foam starts to clear. It will be a dark brown, similar to chocolate. 3. After the rice has simmered for the 15 min, remove it from the heat. Pour the burnt butter over it, being careful not to spatter. Don't stir into the rice. Replace the lid, and let stand for 15 min. Stir and season with salt to taste before serving.

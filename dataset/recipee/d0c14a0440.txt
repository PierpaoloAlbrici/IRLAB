Instructions: 

1. Cook the spaghetti noodles in boiling water, with the 1 tablespoon salt and 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, for the time directed on package. 2. Once cooked, drain in colander and rinse under cold water for about a minute, or until completely cool; allow water to drain completely. 3. Place cool noodles in a large bowl, add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and toss with fingers to prevent them sticking. Add the shredded chicken (or cubed tofu, if substituting), carrots, peanuts and cilantro to the noodles, and place into the refrigerator to keep cold while you prepare the peanut sauce. 4. In a bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, honey, rice vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, the remaining 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and the water until smooth. Remove noodles from the fridge and add the peanut sauce, tossing everything together until well coated. 5. Finally, divide equally among four plates, garnishing with a 1 teaspoon of chopped scallions per plate. Serve cold, and enjoy!

Graham Crackers


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 12 cup of sugars, brown


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350F. In a medium bowl whisk together the flours, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Set aside. The butter should be soft but not runny. In a large bowl beat butter until creamy (and even a little fluffy). Add sugar and honey and beat well. Pour flour mixture into the large bowl and mix with a rubber spatula until the color is uniform and the dough easily forms into a ball. Divide the dough into 4 equal-sized balls. Put each ball in-between parchment or wax paper and roll it out with a rolling pin until it is 1/8-inch thick. (If the dough is too sticky, your room temperature may be too high. Wrap up the dough and put it in the fridge for 30-60 minutes.) Cut the dough into 1 1/2-inch squares. Transfer the squares onto a parchment lined baking sheet about 1/4-inch or more apart. Pierce each square once with a fork. Bake the crackers for 5-8 minutes, rotating once, or until the edges are golden.

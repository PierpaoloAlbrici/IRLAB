### Ingredients

 - 3 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Heat 1 tbs oil in a heavy nonstick skillet over medium heat. Fry scallions and onions 3-4 minutes until soft. Add mushrooms and garlic. Saute over medium high heat 10-15 minutes, until liquid has evaporated. Transfer to a mixing bowl and let cool. Stir in parsley and eggs. Gradually add matzo meal until mixture has enough body to hold together during frying. Add another 1-2 tablespoons matzo meal if necessary. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Heat 2 tbs oil in a heavy nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Form each schnitzel by placing 1 heaping tbs of the mushroom mixture in the hot oil and press with back of a wooden spoon to a 3 inch diameter. Fry 3-4 minutes per side until lightly browned. Drain on paper towels

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of dates, deglet noor

 - 1 cup of nuts, cashew nuts, raw

 - 1/4 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 2 teaspoon of sweetener, syrup, agave

### Instructions

1. If you dont have the strongest food processor, you might want to start by chopping the dates before putting them in the food processor. 2. Put the rest of the ingredients in the processor. 3. Process. 4. This takes awhile. I had to work with mine, lifting up the blade because the dates kept getting stuck under it. After about 5 minutes of babysitting it and holding its hand, it all crumbled into an amazing meal. 5. If you can refrain from eating it all right then, press it into a container of choice. I used a 9x6 glass dish, and they were pretty thin. They stick to your hands a lot, too. You might want to wet your hands. 6. Place them in the fridge for 10 minutes at minimum to allow them to come together. Youll appreciate them more. Maybe. 7. Reward your self-control with a brownie or two for waiting this long.

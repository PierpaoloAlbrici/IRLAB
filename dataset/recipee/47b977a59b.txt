Copycat Willow Tree Chicken Salad


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw


 - 3/4 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular


 - 3 tablespoon of celery, raw


 - 3 tablespoon of onions, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 18 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 1 pinch of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Put the chicken breasts in a mixing bowl. Using a stand mixer with paddle attachment, blend chicken breasts until thoroughly shredded. Or you can shred by hand. (Note: Shredded chicken rather than diced chicken pieces will help recreate the original Willow Tree chicken salad texture.) Remove the bowl from the mixer and add in all the other ingredients. Stir by hand to mix well. Serve over lettuce leaves or in a sandwich.

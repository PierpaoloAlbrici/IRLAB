### Ingredients

 - 12 ounce of noodles, egg, dry, unenriched

 - 3/4 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 2 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 1 teaspoon of cornstarch

 - 2 tablespoon of parsley, fresh

### Instructions

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package directions. In the meantime, make the sauce. In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt the butter. Whisk in the whipping cream and pepper, stirring frequently, until the mixture thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Gradually stir in 1 1/4 cups of the Parmesan cheese. Cook and stir just until the cheese is melted. Whisk in the cornstarch and stir until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Drain the pasta and add the hot noodles to the cheese mixture. Toss until the pasta is well coated. Transfer individual servings of the pasta to plates. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese over each serving, and garnish with the chopped chives or parsley. If you try this recipe, make sure you dont have to drive afterward. Maybe it should come with a warning not to operate heavy machinery after eating!

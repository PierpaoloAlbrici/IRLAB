Sweet and Spicy Shrimp Skewers


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of apricots, dried, sulfured, uncooked


 - 1 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 1 pound of crustaceans, shrimp, raw (not previously frozen)


Instructions: 

In a small bowl, combine the first four ingredients. Take out 1/4 cup of sauce for basting while grilling. Coat the remainder of the shrimp with the sauce. Remember to keep the shrimp cold while it is marinating. Thread shrimp onto metal or soaked wooded skewers. Grill, uncovered, over medium heat or broil 4 inches from the heat for 2-3 minutes on each side, basting with the remainder of the sauce.

 - 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, coriander seed


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cardamom


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, fenugreek seed


 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 13 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 5 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 1 pinch of spices, cloves, ground

Instructions: 

Dissolve the yeast in warm water for 10 minutes. Add the coriander, cinnamon, white pepper, fenugreek, salt, oil and lukewarm water, and stir well. Slowly add the flour until a mass forms. On a floured board, knead the dough for 10 minutes or until it is smooth and tiny bubbles form. (note: this recipe makes a stickier dough than usual) Reserve a 1-inch piece of dough. With floured hands spread the dough out on an ungreased pizza pan. Using a sharp knife, score the dough in a design similar to the spokes of a bicycle wheel. Place the reserved ball of dough in the center of the scored dough. Cover and let rise one hour. Bake at 350F (180C) for an hour or until golden brown. Combine the topping ingredients in a small bowl. While still warm brush the bread with topping.

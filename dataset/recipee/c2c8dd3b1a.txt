Scallion Cream Cheese, Bagel Shop Style


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 1/2 to 3/4 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 2 tablespoon of chives, raw


Instructions: 

Place cream cheese in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix at low speed until smooth. Pour in 1/2 cup heavy cream and raise the speed to medium-low. Mix until whipped and fluffy, adding more cream if needed to loosen the mixture. At low speed, fold in scallions just until combined. Scrape into a serving bowl and keep refrigerated until ready to serve. (Can be made up to 1 day ahead.)

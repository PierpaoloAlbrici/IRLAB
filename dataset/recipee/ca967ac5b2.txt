Tofu with Baby Corn and Peanut Sauce


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of tofu, raw, regular, prepared with calcium sulfate


 - 14 ounce of corn, sweet, white, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, canola


 - 2 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 3/4 cup of oil, corn, peanut, and olive


Instructions: 

Slice the tofu block into 2 planks. Place on a clean folded dish towel and cover with another clean folded dish towel. Place a heavy pot or board with a weight on it so that it evenly covers the tofu. Let sit for 10 to 20 minutes to press out the excess moisture. Slice tofu into cubes. Fry tofu in a large nonstick fry pan until golden brown on all sides, about 10 to 15 minutes. Add baby corn and soy sauce, cook for another 2 minutes, then place on a serving platter and pour the peanut sauce evenly over the tofu.

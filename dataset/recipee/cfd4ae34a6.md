### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Heavily grease a cookie sheet (parchment paper is optional, but if using parchment, make sure it is heavily greased). Sprinkle the coarsely grated Parmesan cheese into a 5 inch diameter circle. Make sure there is just enough to cover the area thinly, don't over do it! Place in the oven and bake for approximately 8 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove the cheese pancakes from the sheet pan and quickly place them over a rolling pin to shape them and allow them to cool. Be extremely gentle with them...they are very brittle when cool. Repeat with remaining cheese.

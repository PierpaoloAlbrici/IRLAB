### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 1 1/2 cup of sugars, powdered

### Instructions

Grind the peanuts in a food processor. Add the sugar and continue mixing, scraping the sides from time to time, until the peanuts release their oil and a compact paste is formed when pressed between your fingers. Be patient as this may take a bit of time depending on your food processor. Put some of the paste into a 2-inch-diameter cookie cutter, filling it up about 3/4 inch high. Press down with your hands until compacted. Remove the cutter carefully and repeat until all the paste is used. Wrap in cellophane or tissue paper like a sugar candy. To prepare the wrapper using cellophane or tissue paper, cut 10 pieces into 4 by 3-inch rectangles. Then cut thin strips of a little less than 1 inch from the short sides toward the center all the way down. Put the marzipans in the center and roll over so the candy is fully covered, then twist the ends.

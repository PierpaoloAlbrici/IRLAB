My Gram Mre's Cheese Bread


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 34 cup of cheese, cheddar


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 14 ounce of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


Instructions: 

Add cheese, butter, sugar and salt to milk. Stir to melt cheese. (I usually wait a little bit so cheese is not completely melted.) Cool to lukewarm. Add yeast to dissolve. (I use fast acting yeast for bread machines.) Add flour-if too soft, add more flour a little at a time. (I started with 1/2 cup less and add more if needed. ). Knead on lightly floured board till smooth. Place in greased bowl (spray w Pam), cover w/ towel and let rise until doubled in bulk. (I prewarm my oven and turn off and put dough in a bowl in the oven to double in the warm oven for approximately 45 minutes. ). Punch down, shape into loaves and place in greased pans (Pam) and let rise until doubled. (I also do this second rise in the prewarmed oven for approximately 1 hour. ). If desired, brush w/ beaten egg, before baking. It gives a nice shine to the bread when finished baking. (I have not done this yet, but mine aren't as pretty as Gram's either ;). Bake 350 degrees until nicely browned, 30 to 60 minutes, depending on size of loaf pan. Check the bottom of loaf to see if it is browned. (I usually do a double batch and make 2 large loves and bake for 43 minutes. ).

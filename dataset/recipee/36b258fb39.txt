Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 350. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt. Add the coconut shavings and 4 ounces of chocolate chunks to the bowl and set aside. In a large bowl, stir together the coconut oil, brown rice syrup, brown sugar, water and coconut extract until well combined. Add the dry ingredients, and mix until evenly incorporated. Scoop the dough into balls with a 1 1/2 tablespoon-size cookie scoop. Arrange the scoops of dough onto baking sheets at least 2 inches apart. Top the cookies with the remaining ounce of chocolate chunks and gently press the pieces into place. Bake for about 8 minutes, and until the chocolate chunks have lightly melted. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for 2 minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.

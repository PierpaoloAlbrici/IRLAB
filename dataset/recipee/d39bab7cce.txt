Divide mixture between two large rimmed baking sheets and spread out into a thin and even layer. Bake 30 minutes, stirring granola once and rotating pans halfway through baking, until granola begins to turn golden. Remove baking sheets from oven and sprinkle chopped dried peaches and ginger evenly on top. Return to oven and bake another 10 minutes until granola is golden brown. Allow granola to cool completely on baking sheets before stirring/serving. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 1 week, in the fridge for 2 weeks or frozen up to 1 month.

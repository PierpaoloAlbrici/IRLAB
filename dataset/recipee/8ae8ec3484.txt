Processor Cinnamon Cookies


Ingredients


 - 34 cup of oil, canola


 - 34 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 13 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract


 - 3 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


Instructions: 

Process oil, sugar, and water until the sugar is completely dissolved. Add cinnamon, salt, and vanilla, and process again. Adding a little at a time, blend in up to 3 1/4 c unbleached white or all-purpose flour, processing between each addition. When the dough is firm but elastic, neither falling apart nor stiff, stop adding flour. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap in a tubular form and chill overnight or freeze until firm. Cut 1/4 inch slices through the wrap with a sharp knife, discard the wrap peelings. Bake cookies at 350 F for approximately 15 minutes. Adjust for altitude as need be. Cool on wire rack, store in air-tight container or refrigerator. They will keep nicely for quite a while.

Sisters Spicy Sweet Potato Wedges


Ingredients


 - 2 pound of sweet potato, raw, unprepared


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, coriander seed


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, fennel seed


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, oregano, dried


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 3 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. 2. Mix the spices together. (Tip: Run 1/3 cup of rice through your coffee grinder to clean it, then empty out.) Run the spices through your coffee grinder or spice mill; set aside. (Run another 1/3 cup of rice through so your coffee grinder is ready for coffee again. No doubt the red pepper flakes would wake you up in the morning, but I cant guarantee youd be in a spectacular mood.) 3. Lay the potatoes on a big rimmed cookie sheet. Toss with the spices and oil. Arrange them so theyre not touching each other. 4. Roast for 20 minutes. 5. Flip your potatoes. 6. Roast for another 10 to 20 minutes, until fork-tender and maybe a little brown.

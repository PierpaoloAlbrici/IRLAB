Miso Spice


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of miso


Instructions: 

Heat the oven to 175. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Smear the miso in an even layer, as thinly as possible, over the parchment. Its O.K. if its ragged around the edges or even a little thick in places. Bake, undisturbed, until large pieces of miso peel easily from the paper, about 3 hours. Turn the pieces and bake on the other side, until the miso crumbles easily, another 3 to 4 hours. Let the miso cool, then crumble it with your fingers or grind finely in a spice mill or designated coffee grinder. (It keeps in the fridge in a sealed jar for months.)

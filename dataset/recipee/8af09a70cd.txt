Grilled Pork Tenderloin with Dijon Mustard


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of pork, fresh, loin, tenderloin, separable lean only, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Preheat the grill to medium heat. Using a paring knife, cut a gulley down the middle of the pork tenderloin end to end. Make sure NOT to cut all the way through. Open the pork loin and lay it flat.

Remove from the grill and tent with foil for 5-10 minutes before slicing.

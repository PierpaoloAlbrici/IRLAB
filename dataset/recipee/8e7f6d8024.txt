Pecan Square Cookies


Ingredients


 - 18 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 34 cup of sugars, brown


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 12 cup of sugars, brown


 - 6 tablespoon of honey


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Heat oven to 375 degrees. To prepare pan: line a 9 by 13 inch pan with heavy duty aluminum foil, leaving overhang so you can pull foil and cookies out after cooling. To make the crust: mix the butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add salt, and mix to combine. Add the flour 1 cup at a time, on medium speed, mixing until fully incorporated after each addition. Continue mixing until the dough begins to come together in even clumps. Dump the dough clumps into the prepared pan and spread them out evenly. Press dough into the prepared 9 by 13 baking pan to about 1/4-inch thick. Prick the pastry with the tines of a fork in 1 inch intervals. Always prick the crust; it keeps the crust from puffing up and forming air pockets. Chill until firm, about 20 minutes. Bake until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Reduce oven to 325 degrees F. To make the filling: Place butter, brown sugar, honey, granulated sugar, heavy cream, and salt in a medium saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly until mixture coats the back of a spoon, about 1 minute. Remove pan from heat; stir in nuts and vanilla. Pour filling onto the cooled crust. Spread the pecans around the crust with a fork to make an even layer. Add a few more pecans to fill in bald spots if necessary. Bake until filling bubbles, 15 to 25 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack to cool completely. When cool lift out cookies and foil in one piece onto a cutting board. Peel foil off the edges so foil lays flat. Use a sharp knife to cut into cookies into 4 rectangles. Then cut each rectangle into 8 cookies for a total of 32 cookies. Store in an airtight container, up to 1 week.

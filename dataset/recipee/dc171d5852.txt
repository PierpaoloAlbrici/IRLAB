Creole Peanut Pralines Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of sugars, brown


 - 1 pound of oil, corn, peanut, and olive


 - 4 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Shell the peanuts, chop, and combine with the butter. In a saucepan, stir together sugar and water, bring to a boil, stirring constantly, continuing to cook till a syrup forms. Add in the peanuts, and stir till the mix begins to bubble, then remove from the heat. Working quickly, place a Tbsp. at a time on a cool, buttered (preferably marble) slab or possibly a large dish and press into a circle 1/4 inch thick and 4 inches in diameter. Leave to dry without disturbing, then lift with a knife. Pralines should be light, crispy, and flaky.

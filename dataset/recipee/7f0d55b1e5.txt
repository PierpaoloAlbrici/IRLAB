Blueberry Lemon Sauce


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of blueberries, raw


 - 1/3 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 2 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

In a saucepan on medium heat, bring the blueberries, sugar, salt, and a tablespoon of water to a simmer, stirring often, until the mixture is juicy.

### Ingredients

 - 4 ounce of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

 - 3 ounce of nuts, hazelnuts or filberts

 - 2 ounce of spices, coriander seed

 - 1 ounce of spices, cumin seed

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 teaspoon of corn, sweet, white, raw

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, thyme, dried

### Instructions

Dry roast sesame seeds until lightly browned, then remove from pan. Roast the hazelnuts for about 5 minutes and then remove their skins by rubbing them in a kitchen towel. If you choose to use the roasted chickpeas, they don't need further roasting. Dry roast the coriander and cumin seeds just until they darken. Remove from pan. When everything has cooled off, add other ingredients and pound or process to a coarse powder in a food processor. This will keep for 3 months in a cool place, in an airtight container or jar.

Scott's Dry Pork and Rib Rub


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of sugars, brown


 - 3 tablespoon of spices, paprika


 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, oregano, dried


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, thyme, dried


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, onion powder


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, chili powder


 - 12 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


Instructions: 

Sift all ingredients together.I use a food processor to get a fine powder. Put a liberal amount of the dry rub on the meat you wish to season. Rub seasoning into the meat, covering entire surface. Let meat sit at least a couple of hours in order to let the spices work into it. Overnight is better. Prepare your pork as you wish. I like to cook pork butts and ribs low and slow so they fall apart. A crockpot works good if you don't want to run your oven for several hours. I finish my ribs on the grill or under the broiler with BBQ sauce. Enjoy.

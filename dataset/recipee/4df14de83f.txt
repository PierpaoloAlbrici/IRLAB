Peanut Buster Parfait Ice Cream Cake


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of sugars, powdered


 - 13 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 1/4 cup of butter, without salt


 - 3/4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 quart of ice creams, vanilla


 - 1/2 cup of oil, corn, peanut, and olive


Instructions: 

Line an 8-inch round baking pan with foil. Mix together cookie crumbs and melted butter until evenly combined. Press into the bottom of the prepared pan. Prepare chocolate sauce by placing the icing sugar, semi-sweet chocolate chips, butter and evaporated milk in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Simmer for 7 minutes, until slightly thickened (it will thicken more as it cools). Cool completely, whisking occasionally to prevent a skin from forming. To prepare the cake, top the cookie crumbs in the pan with half of the ice cream, peanuts and chocolate sauce. Repeat layers. Freezing in between if necessary. Once fully assembled, freeze until solid (about 2 hours). To serve: loosen foil from sides of pan (warming up with hands if necessary) and lift out. Peel away foil; slice and serve.

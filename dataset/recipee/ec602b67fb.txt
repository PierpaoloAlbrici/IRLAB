Ultra-Simple & Ultra-Low-Cal Sweet Potato Cream


Ingredients


 - 100 g of sweet potato, raw, unprepared


 - 5 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 5 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Peel a pre-cooked (boiled or microwaved) sweet potato. Put all the ingredients in a blender or food processor, and mix until creamy. You can just eat it as is or spread it on bread. It's also just the right consistency to pipe out, so it's great for decorating cakes. You can use it as a topping for Mont Blanc desserts too. The sweet potatoes you get in Spain where I live are orange, so they look like this, but Japanese sweet potatoes will make a yellow chestnut coloured cream. I tripled this recipe here, mixed it with 200 ml of whipped cream, and used it to decorate a cake. It was amazingly delicious!

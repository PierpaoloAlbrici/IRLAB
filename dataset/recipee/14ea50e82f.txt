Fluffy White Bread


Ingredients


 - 3 1/2 teaspoon of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 3 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 tablespoon of vital wheat gluten


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Measure yeast directly into bread machine pan. Measure milk into a microwave-safe container. Add honey and sugar, then microwave until warm (not hot). Stir to incorporate ingredients. Pour the warm milk mixture on top of the yeast. Now let those yeasty beasties enjoy their warm bath while you prepare and mix the rest of the ingredients. They like warm baths, so take your time! Measure the bread flour, butter, salt, and vital wheat gluten into a bowl. Did you take your time? If not, dance around your kitchen, sing a showtune, or organize a cupboard. You want the yeast to relax in the pan for around 10 minutes before you put it to work. Once its ready, add the dry ingredients to the loaf pan on top of the milk mixture. Pop it into the bread machine, then start it up. Use the Basic setting, 1-1/2 lb loaf. I bake mine with a medium crust and it takes 3-1/2 hours.

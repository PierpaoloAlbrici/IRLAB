### Ingredients

 - 150 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 100 g of rice flour, white, unenriched

 - 10 g of sugars, granulated

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 150 ml of water, bottled, generic

 - 20 g of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

Mix flour, rice flour, 10 g brown sugar, dry yeast salt and warm water in a bowl. Mix until the dough comes together. Remove the dough from the bowl and put sesame seeds in. Put the dough back in the bowl and knead with the sesame seeds until all of them are mixed in. Take dough out of bowl and knead on a floured surface until smooth (5-10 min.) It will look like this! Divide dough into 4 equal pieces and roll into balls. Put in bowl, cover with moist cloth and let rest for 20 minutes. Roll out each dough ball into a long, flat oval shape. Fold the oval shape into thirds so it's a rectangle/square shape. Roll out this into a long rectangle about 15-17 cm (6-7 in). Roll up the long rectangle lengthwise into a tube shape... like this! Shape into a round bagel, overlapping the ends and squeezing together so they hold. Lay out on a tray on baking paper and cover with a moist cloth. Put in refrigerator to slowly rise overnight (or about 8 hours). The next day they'll be a little fatter like this! Preheat oven to 200C/400F. Bring plenty of water to a boil and dissolve 2 tablespoons of sugar in the water. Boil the bagels for 5 minutes (turn half way through) Arrange boiled bagels on a baking sheet and bake at 200C/400F for about 15 minutes.

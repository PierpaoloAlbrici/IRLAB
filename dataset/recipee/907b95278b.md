### Ingredients

 - 20 ounce of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw

 - 1 cup of syrup, maple, canadian

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Slice summer sausage into 1/4" rounds - remove plastic coating from around sausage after you slice as it is easier that way. Heat butter into large skillet completely coating bottom. Add syrup, slightly stir and let sit on medium heat until bubbling slightly. Place rounds into pan and let cook 3-4 minutes until bubbled up (like bologna) and a rich red color on bottom, turn and cook other side, they may not bubble back the other way but 3-4 minutes should be good. Remove from pan onto plate, twisting them over the pan to get rid of any excess syrup. Enjoy!

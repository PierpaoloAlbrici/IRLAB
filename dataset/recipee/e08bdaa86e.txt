Almond Buttercrunch


Ingredients


 - 3/4 cup of butter, without salt


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 2 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, almonds


Instructions: 

In a saucepan over low heat, combine the butter, sugar and 1 cup chopped almonds. Stir constantly until mixture boils, then do not stir or shake. Heat to 300 to 310 degrees F (149 to 154 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard, brittle threads. Pour onto a large buttered cookie sheet. Immediately press chocolate chips onto the hot candy. As the chocolate melts, spread it into a coating over the candy. Sprinkle finely chopped almonds over the top; cool, and break into uneven pieces.

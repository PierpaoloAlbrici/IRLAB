Egg Free Chocolate Frosting (Very Good)


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


 - 2 1/2 tablespoon of honey


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 12 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


 - 2 1/2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 1/2 cup of sugars, powdered


Instructions: 

Place margarine, honey, and vanilla in mixing bowl. Sift cocoa into this bowl. Using electric beaters at low speed, cream these ingredients together. Add water and sift powdered sugar into mixture. Beat with electric beaters on medium speed until well mixed. Use frosting to frost cake. To assemble a layer cake: place one layer of cake in center of serving platter, upside down (so that the flat side of the cake, which was on the bottom of the cake pan, is facing you). Using a frosting spatula, spread top of this layer with frosting. Place remaining layer on top of this, right-side up. Spread frosting over top and sides of entire cake. Serve.

### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)

 - 6 tablespoon of butter, salted

 - 6 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

1. Pop popcorn on stove according to directions on container. 2. While the corn is heating, melt butter in a microwave safe bowl big enough to hold butter and sugar together. Heat in 15 second intervals. Cover with napkin to keep microwave from getting splattered. 3. When the butter is melted add sugar to the bowl and put in microwave to heat, about 20 sec. If this is finished before corn is done popping, just heat again for 10 sec. right before pouring over the popped corn, mix a little. 4. When corn is done popping, turn off the heat and immediately add the butter/sugar. Use a spoon to scrape it out of the bowl. The butter should sizzle in the pot. Use a large spoon to mix the popcorn until all covered. Don't shake, the sugar stays crystallized instead of caramelizing (I don't know why). 5. Pour into a bowl and ENJOY! It may be a bit hot so be careful -- I can never wait for it to cool.

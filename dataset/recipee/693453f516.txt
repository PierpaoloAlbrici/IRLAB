Honey Roasted Peanut Butter


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of honey


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, corn, peanut, and olive


Instructions: 

Transfer the peanuts to a heavy-duty food processor and process the nuts on high for about 5 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl every minute or so, and checking to see that the nuts havent stuck under your food processor blade. Once the peanut butter looks smooth, add the salt and then process for another minute or so to make sure the butter looks glossy and smooth. If you dont have a heavy-duty food processor, add the peanut oil to help the butter along (see notes). Transfer the peanut butter to a small mason jar or airtight storage container. Peanut butter can be used immediately and will keep for several weeks in the fridge. Note: You shouldnt need to add any oil to this recipe unless you do not have a heavy-duty food processor. What makes this peanut butter nice and smooth is time. Keep processing, scrape down the bowl, and process again. It will come together in under 10 minutes, I promise!

Crystallized Orange Nuts


Ingredients


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 14 cup of orange juice, raw


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 cup of nuts, pecans


Instructions: 

Butter a large cookie sheet (one that has sides). Using a 2 quart glass baking dish, pour orange juice into sugar, and mix well. Stir in pecans. Cover with plastic wrap, but leave a corner open to vent. Microwave on medium for 6 minutes. Stir and continue to cook on medium for about 4 - 6 more minutes until the syrup crystallizes (check after 4 minutes, and then each minute thereafter). As soon as it's crystallized, spread glazed nuts on the buttered cookie sheet evenly, separating the nuts. Let it cool completely.

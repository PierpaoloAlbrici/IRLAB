### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 3/4 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow

 - 4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, thyme, dried

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, rosemary, dried

 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1/2 cup of corn, sweet, white, raw

 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 450 F. Reserve 1/4 cup of flour. Combine the remaining flour with the cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, salt, sugar, thyme, and rosemary in a large mixing bowl. 2. Cut the butter into the flour mixturebasically, just quickly rub the butter into the flour with your hands until the mixture is coarse and resembles cornmeal. 3. Stir milk and corn kernels (if youre using them) into the mixture. Turn dough out onto a floured cutting board and knead the reserved flour (1/4 cup) into the dough until it is no longer sticky. (You may need to use a bit more flour if the dough is especially sticky). 4. Pat the dough out to about 1/2 inch thickness and cut into 2-inch rounds with a biscuit cutter. 5, Lightly grease a large cast-iron skillet and arrange cut biscuits in a single layer. Give them a little breathing room, because theyll rise quite a bit in the oven. Depending on the size of your skillet, you may need to bake in two batches or bake some of the biscuits on a separate baking sheet. My skillet is about 8 inches in diameter and doesnt quite fit all of the biscuits, so I bake in two batches. 6. Bake at 450 F for 13-16 minutes until biscuits are lightly browned. Serve warm with butter and a bit of honey. Theyre also great with chili or pulled pork. I love to use them for pulled pork sliders!

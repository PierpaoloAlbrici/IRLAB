Fluffy Vegan Pancakes


Ingredients


 - 3/4 cup of beverages, almond milk, unsweetened, shelf stable


 - 2 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of seeds, flaxseed


 - 3 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

1. Combine the almond milk with the vinegar or lemon juice in a small dish and set aside for 5-10 minutes. 2. Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. 3. In a small bowl whisk the ground flax seed and water until thick and creamy. Add this into the milk mixture. 4. Slowly add the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until thoroughly combined and any large lumps are gone. 5. Heat a large skillet over medium to medium high heat and coat with cooking spray. 6. Use a 1/4 cup scoop to pour batter onto the skillet, leaving space between each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the top surface, flip, and cook until the bottom is golden brown. Remove cooked pancakes to a plate while you cook the rest of the batter. Serve warm.

Ingredients


 - 1 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


 - 2 cup of dates, deglet noor


 - 2 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


 - 1/2 cup of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried


Instructions: 

1. Set aside half of the coconut in a shallow bowl. 2. Combine all the other ingredients in a food processor and pulse, scraping the sides as necessary until a soft dough is formed. 3. Shape the mixture into bite-sized balls. 4. Roll the balls in the set aside coconut. Notes : 1. The recipe works best with juicy, plump dates.

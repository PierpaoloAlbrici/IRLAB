 - 140 g of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 14 g of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


Instructions: 

Add all the ingredients except for the margarine to the bread maker tray, set to create dough (45 minute rise) and start. Add the margarine after 5 minutes. Remove and deflate the dough, then split it into 2. Roll into rounds and let them sit for 15 minutes. Use a rolling pin to stretch out into long shapes. Fold in the top and bottom into the center and close. Match the length of the cake pan. Place the dough in a tray and allow to rise a 2nd time for 35 to 40 minutes. I use a Pyrex deep pound cake pan - width 21.5 x depth 12 cm x height 7 cm, 1.5 L. Once it's risen to emerge 1 - 2 cm from the pan, place in the 160C preheated oven and bake at 160C for 8 minutes, then at 200C for 28 minutes (36 minutes all together). Once it's baked, remove from the pan immediately and cool. Enjoy as-is, or toasted until golden. Both are delicious. Check out this Shokupanman Pizza that a reader made.

Healthy Peanut Butter Balls


Ingredients


 - 13 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 12 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 2 tablespoon of wheat germ, crude


 - 1 tablespoon of honey


Instructions: 

Place ingredients into food blender in the order listed. Turn on and blend until mixture is evenly mixed and crumbly looking. Use a small melon ball scoop to make the peanut butter balls. Push the peanut butter mixture in there so its nice and compact like brown sugar. Put onto a plate or in a container and put in the fridge. You can eat them right away but they are really good after they've sat in the fridge for a little while. Enjoy! You can also use creamy peanut butter, but I'm a crunchy kinda gal. Also you can roll the balls in additional wheat germ for an even crunchier ball.

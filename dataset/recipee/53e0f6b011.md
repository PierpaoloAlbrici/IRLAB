[53e0f6b011](http://cookeatshare.com/recipes/bread-stuffing-for-turkey-works-well-with-chicken-also-91698)

### Ingredients

 - 8 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 1/4 pound of butter, without salt

 - 1/4 cup of onions, raw

 - 1/2 cup of celery, raw

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/4 cup of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry

### Instructions

Heat the butter in a skillet and stir in the onion (we do not add in the celery because we like it to keep its crunch, but you can cook it with the onion if desired). Cook over low heat till the onion is soft. Add in this mix to the cubed bread along with the celery and toss lightly with the seasonings. Add in the chicken broth to taste. We do not add in too much broth if we are cooking the stuffing in the turkey, but add in more if we are cooking the stuffing in the oven. This recipe is sufficient for an 11 - 12 lb. turkey. Make 1 and 1/2 times the recipe (or possibly more) if your turkey is bigger or possibly if you want extra stuffing. We have experimented with fancy stuffings but always come back to Mom's in the end.

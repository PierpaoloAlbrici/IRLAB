Warm Marmalade Sauce


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 12 cup of marmalade, orange


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Bring cream, marmalade and butter to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Reduce heat slightly and cook until sauce has thickened, approximately 20 - 30 minutes. The sauce takes on a golden colour and should thickly coat the back of a spoon. (Watch towards the end of the cooking period or the butter will end up seperating from the sauce and it becomes tacky on the ice cream). Spoon over ice cream. Note: This sauce can be prepared while you are serving dinner. The only draw back is that you need to periodically "stir the pot" so that the mixture does not burn.

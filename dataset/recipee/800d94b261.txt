Peanut Butter Pretzel Balls


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 1/2 cup of pretzels, soft, unsalted


 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

Combine the peanut butter and chopped pretzels in a bowl and mix well. Freeze the peanut butter mixture for at least 30 minutes. Roll about 1 1/2 tablespoons of the peanut butter mixture into a ball with your hands. You may need to refreeze the balls if the peanut butter softens too much. (This is why crunchy peanut butter is best, to help shape the balls). Melt the chocolate chips until runny. Dip the peanut butter balls into the chocolate until fully coated and place on a plate covered with waxed paper. Be careful to not let the balls touch each other before the chocolate has set. Sprinkle with your favorite decoration if you like. Refrigerate to allow the chocolate to harden, then serve.

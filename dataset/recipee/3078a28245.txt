Simple Secret Icing


Ingredients


 - 4 ounce of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of sugars, powdered


 - 1/4 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


 - 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 3 tablespoon of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 2 tablespoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Melt the chocolate in a stainless steel bowl over a pan of simmering water or in a warm oven and set aside. Cream the butter in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment at medium speed until very soft. Switch to the whisk attachment, add the confectioners sugar, and continue whipping at medium speed for a minute or two, stopping the mixer to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl as needed. This mixture should be very soft and fluffy. Combine the cocoa powder and water in a mixing cup or small bowl and stir it into a warm paste. Allow it to cool a little. This is your cocoa paste. Add the melted milk chocolate, cocoa paste, cream, vanilla, and salt to the mixing bowl and whip at low speed until smooth. If it is too thin to spread onto a cake or cookie and hold its shape, chill it for 20 minutes or so. If it is still too thin, whisk in some more butter and chill again. If it is too thick, add a little more cream. Chill the icing with the whip attachment in the bowl; whip it up one last time before using.

### Instructions

Whichever version you pick, it makes enough for 1 pound of taco meat of choice. Mix all ingredients in a bowlpick either the hot or the mild mixture based on your heat preference, or make both in a separate bowl. Add a batch into 1 pound of your taco meat of choice (*see below for prep instructions), sprinkle it on popcorn or mix it in double baked taters! Serve with tissues. * A Thalice Tip: I like to whisk the seasoning into 2/3 cup water (when cooking with a pound of meat), adding the spice broth to the meat once it has started to cook. I let the mixture simmer until the liquid has reduced to a sauce consistency and the meat has cooked through. Adapted from AllRecipes Taco Seasoning I recipe.

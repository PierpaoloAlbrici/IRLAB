Ginger and Honey Glazed Carrots


Ingredients


 - 6 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 3 pound of carrots, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


 - 4 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Line a baking sheet with paper towels. In a 12- or 14-inch heavy skillet bring water to boiling, add carrots. Return to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer about 10 to 12 minutes or until carrots are just tender and drain. (I prefer to use my Cuisinart Turbo Convection Steamer ). Carefully turn out onto prepared baking sheet. (When green tops are left on carrots during cooking, they become very fragile. As the carrots cook, some of the tops may come off. ). Pat dry with additional paper towels. To glaze carrots, in the same heavy skillet combine margarine, honey, ginger, and salt. Stir constantly over medium heat until margarine is melted. Carefully add carrots. Toss gently for 2 to 3 minutes or until carrots are thoroughly coated with glaze and heated through completely. To serve, arrange carrots in a shallow bowl or on a platter; drizzle with remaining glaze from pan.

Yummy Hot Chocolate


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 3 ounce of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022


Instructions: 

For frothy hot chocolate: Bring the milk just to a boil. Put the chocolate in a blender and pour in the hot milk. Let sit for 10 to 15 seconds so the chocolate begins to melt and then cover securely, place a folded towel over the lid, and blend until completely mixed and frothy, about 30 seconds. For unfrothy hot chocolate: Heat the milk in a saucepan until it just begins to boil. Remove the pan from the heat, add the chocolate, and stir or whisk until well blended.

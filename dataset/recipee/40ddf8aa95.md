### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1/2 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Place the granulated sugar in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stirring constantly with a rubber spatula, allow the sugar to heat. It will clump together as it starts to melt and then will start turning to liquid. Keep stirring so it doesnt burn and continue until completely melted into an amber coloured liquid. Once the sugar is melted, immediately add the pieces of butter. The liquid will bubble up when you add the butter. Stir the caramel until the butter is completely melted, about 2 minutes. Slowly drizzle in the heavy cream while still stirring. Be careful as the caramel will bubble up a lot when you add the cream. Allow this mixture to boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly, and then remove from the heat. Stir in the salt. It will be extremely hot so allow it to cool down a bit before using it or pouring it into another container. Cover it tightly and store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. You can warm it up in the microwave before using it. I like to scoop the amount Im going to use into another small bowl to heat up. I find microwaving it multiple times will cause it to not melt quite as nicely. Adapted slightly from Sallys Baking Addiction.

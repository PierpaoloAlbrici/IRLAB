### Ingredients

 - 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 ounce of cheese, cheddar

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 2 to 3 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Preheat the Oven to 350F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment and set aside. Combine the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, corn flour, oat flour, and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the dough blade and pulse to combine. Add the cheese and Coconut oil, and pulse to incorporate. Scrape down the sides of the food processor to free any trapped flour. With the food processor running, drizzle in the hot water, a little at a time, just until the mixture begins to pull together. You may not use all of the water. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gather it into a ball. Knead gently once or twice. Roll out the dough until it is slightly less than 1/8 inch thick. Using a very small fish-shaped cutter, or the cutter of your choice, cut out the crackers and carefully place them on the prepared baking sheets. Bake until golden around the edges, about 10 to 12 minutes, and cool before serving.

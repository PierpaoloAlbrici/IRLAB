### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 13 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground

 - 18 teaspoon of spices, cloves, ground

 - 1/4 cup of butter, salted

 - 1/4 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

 - 1/2 cup of seeds, pumpkin and squash seeds, whole, roasted, without salt

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

 - 1/2 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a mixing bowl (for a stand mixer), combine dry ingredients and cubed butter. With the paddle attachment, run your mixer on medium-low until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. This will take a few minutes. While mixer is running, whisk together peanut butter, squash, vanilla and buttermilk until smooth. When flour mixture is ready, with the mixer running on low, add chocolate chips and then the squash/peanut mixture to the bowl. Turn mixer off when everything is just combined, taking care not to over-mix. Turn dough out on to a floured surface and fold in to a ball (roughly 8-10 turns). Do not overwork the dough and try not to use a heavy hand. Pat dough in to a circle about 2 inches deep and cut in to 8 triangles. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 1820 minutes. Allow scones to cool on a wire rack.

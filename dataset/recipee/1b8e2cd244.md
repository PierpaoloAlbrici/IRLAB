### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw

 - 2 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, onion powder

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 teaspoon of a cajun life, all purpose cajun seasoning, upc: 095225879272

### Instructions

Mix the salts, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder together and put into a salt shaker; set aside. Preheat oven to 150F. Cut chicken into 1/8th inch strips or 1/8th inch cubes (thickness doesn't have to be exact, can be a little thicker). On a cutting board, sprinkle each strip evenly and heavily then with a meat mallet, rolling pin or pan, pound mixture into chicken. Turn chicken over and repeat. Place strips in single layer on a oven-safe metal cookie cooling rack (fine mesh or closely spaced bars work best). Cook chicken until dry but not brittle, 4 to 5 hours, rearranging once. Cooking times for turkey or venison are the same. Refrigerate for storage.

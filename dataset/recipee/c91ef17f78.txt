Easy Ice Cream Made with Marshmallows


Ingredients


 - 20 g of candies, marshmallows


 - 70 ml of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Put the marshmallows and milk in a fairly large heatproof container and cover lightly with plastic wrap. Microwave for 1 minute. Stir to dissolve the marshmallows. If the marshmallows don't melt, microwave for 1 more minute. Let cool, then chill in the freezer. In about 30 minutes to 1 hour, the mixture will be half frozen. Mix well. Freeze for another 30 minutes to 1 hour. When it's firm all the way through, stir it up again, and serve. It's creamy and delicious. (The freezing time depends on the temperature of the ingredients and your freezer.) You can add jam in the last mixing to make your favorite flavor. The one in the photo is blueberry. Note: Metal bowls will spark if you put them in the microwave. Be sure use a container that is microwave and freezer-safe, so you can put the bowl directly into the freezer. Note: If you double or triple the recipe, use a large container and cover lightly with plastic wrap. The microwave time is the same, one minute. If it isn't completely melted, microwave again, one minute at a time. One person who tried it said that if you use soy milk and 1 tablespoon of powdered skim milk, it comes out really well.

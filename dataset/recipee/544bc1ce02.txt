Irish Soda Bread with Yogurt


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of oats


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and spray a lined baking sheet with pan spray. Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl, then rub in the butter with your fingers. Mix in the milk and yogurt mix by hand, being gentle as you handle it (you dont want to over-knead it). Turn it onto a floured surfaced and shape it into a flat, round loaf about 1-1/2 thick. Transfer to the baking sheet and score a deep cross in the top. Bake for 30-35 minutes until browned and the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Let cool on a rack before serving.

Ingredients


 - 6 ounce of raspberries, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 cup of lemon juice, raw


 - 4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1/4 cup of raspberries, raw


Instructions: 

For the Raspberry Sauce: Place the thawed raspberries in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a blade attachment. Add sugar and water and mix until the raspberries form a smooth puree. Transfer raspberry puree to a fine mesh strainer fit over a bowl. Press the puree through the strainer, until only the raspberry seeds and a bit of pulp remain the the strainer, and a beautiful raspberry sauce is all thats in the bowl. For the Lemonade: Make simple syrup by heating the sugar and water in a small saucepan until the sugar is dissolved completely. While the sugar is dissolving, use a juicer to extract the juice from 4 to 6 lemons, enough for one cup of juice. Add the juice and the sugar water to a pitcher. Add 4 cups of cold water, more or less to the desired strength. Add the prepared raspberry sauce and stir to combine. Refrigerate 30 to 40 minutes. If the lemonade is a little sweet for your taste, add a little more straight lemon juice to it. Serve over ice. Youll have extra raspberry sauce, save it for your next ice cream sundae or next batch of lemonade!

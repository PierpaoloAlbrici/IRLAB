### Ingredients

 - 3 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 2 tablespoon of chives, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of parsley, fresh

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 3 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 10 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

### Instructions

Saute the first 4 ingredients in oil and butter in a large skillet for 1 minute. Add the bread cubes, and toss gently until the liquid is absorbed. Spread the bread cubes in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes or until crisp and golden, stirring occasionally. Store the croutons in an airtight container once they are completely cooled. Serve over tossed green salads. (Or, if you are like me, sneak guiltily into the kitchen and have some for a midnight snack! ).

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Stir the flour, olive oil, salt, and hot water together. Knead the dough, adding extra water as needed until your dough is smooth and stretchy. Let the dough rest about 5 minutes. Heat up a griddle or skillet on medium heat. Divide your dough into 8 balls. Roll the balls of dough into tortillas on a non-stick surface with a rolling pin. Lay one rolled out tortilla at a time on the warm griddle and let it cook about 2-3 minutes. Flip and let cook for about 2 minutes on the other side. Set aside and make the remaining tortillas!

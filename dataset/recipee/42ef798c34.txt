Spun Sugar dessert garnishment


Ingredients


 - 2/3 cup of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

You'll need a non-stick Teflon pan and put it on the burner and turn the heat on low for one minute Once the pan has heated add the sugar, and turn the heat to a medium high heat, just leave the sugar alone and let it sit until it starts to caramelize around the edges. DO NOT STIR THE SUGAR! ! When the sugar start to caramelize, you'll see the sugar begin to liquify, pick up the pan by the handle and slowly rotate the pan above the burner in either direction so that the granulated sugar melts into the caramelized sugar. You can return the pan to the burner so that it gets bubbly. Be careful not to use high heat as it will burn the sugar. The caramelized sugar will start to turn a yellowish color, once it turns a brown you can turn the burner off and let it stand for 2 minutes After the caramelized sugar has set for two minutes the sugar should be liquidy enought to stir. After you can start to use whatever tools you have to make your spun sugar designs. Have some parchment paper or wax paper laid out as your work surface. Be very careful the sugar is hot. The sugar starts to harden an cool fast so you can return the pan back to the burner giving it a blast of heat to help loosen it. I myself used a metal ladle, large metal mixing spoon, metal spatula without the holes. I turned them all upsides down. Using a wooden spoon you slowly drizzled the sugar over the backs of your utensils and let it set.

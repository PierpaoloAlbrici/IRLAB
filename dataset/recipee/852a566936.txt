In a large bowl, combine cereal, pretzels (broken into bite-sized pieces), and cashews (also broken into pieces). Set aside. Over a double broiler, or on very low heat, carefully melt chocolate chips and oil in a medium saucepan. Once smooth, remove from heat. Pour melted chocolate into cereal mixture.

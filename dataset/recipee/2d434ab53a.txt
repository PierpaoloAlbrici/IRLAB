Craig's Dry Rub for a Smoker


Ingredients


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, paprika


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, chili powder


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, chili powder


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 1 pinch of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1 teaspoon of celery, raw


 - 12 tablespoon of spices, cumin seed


Instructions: 

1. Mix all ingredients well. 2. Remove the membrane from the ribs. If i'm lazy, I'll just slash it up with a smal paring knife. 3. Spread a thin layer on ribs and pre-marinated chicken and rub in well. For the chicken, we apply it under the skin on top and bottom and in the cavity. Get intimate with the meat and don't be afraid to get dirty. 4. Place in plastic bags and remove as much air as you can and leave in the fridge overnight. 5. Heat your smoker to 200-225 and smoke for 3.5 hours, adding wood chunks as needed. I soak them first but I don't think it makes much difference. 6. Brush on your favorite sauce (or not) and wrap in foil and smoke for another 1.5 hours. (Try a spicy raspberry sauce for a nice change. ).

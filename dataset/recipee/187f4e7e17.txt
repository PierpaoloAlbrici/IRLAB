 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 6 quart of soup, vegetable broth, ready to serve


 - 12 cup of wild rice, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, tarragon, dried

 - 3 tablespoon of spices, curry powder


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cumin seed


 - 14 cup of peppers, sweet, green, raw

Instructions: 

In a soup pot, melt the butter over medium high heat. Let the water bubble out and the butter just start to brown. Quickly add in your aromatics( carrots, onion, celery, and garlic). Let these sweat over medium heat for at least ten minutes. You want these to be just soft. Add in your flour and stir well to get it worked inches This will thicken your soup and hold the yogurt together later, but you don't want any lumps so get it mixed up well. Add your corn into the mix and sweat for 2 or 3 more minutes. Add the sugar, the stock, and the rice to the pot. Bring to a simmer, add in the spices and bell pepper and allow to simmer for 25 minutes or until the rice is chewable (eild rice never really gets tender). Omit the heat and then whisk in the yogurt. The flour in your soup will help to hold the yogurt and keep it from curdling, but just in case don't boil the soup anymore after you add the yogurt. Adjust seasonings to your liking.

Super Flaky Blackberry Turnovers


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of cream, sour, cultured


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 3 cup of blackberries, raw


 - 13 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 3 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 13 cup of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

For the dough: In a small bowl stir together the sour cream and sugar. Set aside. In a large bowl mix flours and salt. Cut cold butter into into the flour mixture until mixture resembles coarse meal. Using a fork gently toss the sour cream mixture in with the flour mixture. Dough will be very soft. Divide dough into two equal sections. Shape each section of into a rectangle and wrap them in plastic wrap. Refrigerate dough at least 1 hour. Remove one piece of dough from the refrigerator and roll into a 9-inch x 18-inch rectangle between two sheets plastic wrap or parchment paper. Spread the top with a tablespoon of room temperature butter and fold the rectangle of dough in thirds like a business letter. Repeat folding dough in thirds in opposite direction to end with a square. Wrap up the square and refrigerate for 2 hours. Repeat with the remaining section of dough and butter. For the filling: In a medium-sized bowl combine blackberries, sugar and flour. Set aside. If using frozen blackberries set aside until blackberries defrost. For the assembly: Preheat oven to 375 F. Line 2 baking sheets with a Silpat or a sheet of parchment paper. Roll out each piece of dough until its about 1/8-inch thick. Cut out 4 1/2 inch rounds. You can gather scraps, chill and re-roll dough to make additional turnovers. Each piece of dough will yield about 7 or 8 turnovers. Transfer each dough round to a baking sheet and fill with 2 tablespoons of blackberries. Moisten the edge of the dough with a little water on your finger and fold dough in half, using a fork to crimp together the edges of dough. Poke 4 steam holes in the center of each turnover using a fork. Sprinkle each turnover with a pinch of sugar. Bake for 20-30 minutes. Rotate baking sheets 10 minutes into baking. Bake until turnovers are puffed, firm to the touch and golden brown. Remove to a cooling rack. Recipe by Serena Bakes Simply From Scratch adapted from Dorie Greenspan.

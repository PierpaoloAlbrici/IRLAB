### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 12 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 2 teaspoon of orange juice, raw

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

 - 18 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

Cream the butter until it is nice and light. Cream in the sugar, orange peel, and the spices. Now work in the flour. Knead the dough on an unfloured board until nice and smooth. Spray the shortbread pan very lightly with non stick veggie spray. Firmly press the dough into the shortbread pan. Prick the entire surface with a fork, and bake right in the pan. Bake at 325 degrees for about 30-35 minutes, or until lightly browned. Let shortbread cool in its pan for about 10 minutes before you loosen the edges with a knife and flip the pan over onto a wooden cutting board. If the shortbread does not come right out, tap one edge of the pan. Cut the shortbread into serving pieces while it is still warm.

### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of asparagus, raw

 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Remove woody ends from asparagus and discard. Place asparagus in large ziploc bag. Pour in oil and sprinkle seasoning. Close bag forcing out air. Rub asparagus through bag to evenly distribute seasonings. Grill to your taste. We use a pan for the grill that has holes in it. Often serve with grilled shrimp since it can all be placed in the same pan. Delicious.

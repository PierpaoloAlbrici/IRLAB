Buttered Noodles With Garlicky Bread Crumbs Recipe


Ingredients


 - 3/4 pound of salt, table


 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 1/2 cup of bread crumbs, dry, grated, plain


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 1/3 cup of parsley, fresh


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Cook noodles in salted water according to package directions. Reserve 1/2 c. cooking liquid. Drain. Add in just a little reserved liquid to moisten but not sufficient to really wet them. (Can be made ahead and reheated in microwave oven, adding more liquid if noodles are dry.) Heat butter in large nonstick skillet over medium heat. When melted, add in bread crumbs and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, till golden, about 2 min. Stir in parsley, scant 1/2 tsp. salt and pepper to taste. (Can be made a day ahead, refrigerated and gently reheated stovetop when ready to serve.) To serve, toss warm noodles with hot crumb mix. Serve immediately. This recipe yields 6 to 8 servings. NOTES :

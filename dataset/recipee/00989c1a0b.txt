Vegan Shortbread


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


 - 12 cup of sugars, brown


 - 2 1/8 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


Instructions: 

Pre-heat oven to 300F. Cream together margarine and sugar. Add sifted flour 1/4 cup at a time. Use hands to mix into a soft, smooth dough. With hands press into a 1-2cm thick rectangle and use sharp knife to cut into fingers. Use fork to make pretty shortbread holes. Place in oven for 25 minutes. Let cool on tray for 5 minutes. EXTRA NOTES:. This shortbread is not overly sweet - feel free to add another loosely packed TBS or 2 of brown sugar to the mix. Feel free to sprinkle granulated sugar on top before baking. Also depending on your oven cookies can be ready after only 15-20 minutes or can be cooked for up to 50 minutes (for extra crunch and with a very golden bottom). Keep an eye on shortbread for your preference.

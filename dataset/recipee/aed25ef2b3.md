### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

 - 13 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 3/4 cup of currants, zante, dried

 - 1 teaspoon of orange juice, raw

 - 2 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 3/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 tablespoon of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 3/4 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400F (200C). Use an ungreased baking sheet. Combine the flour, 13 cup of the sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a mixing bowl. Stir with a fork to mix well and aerate. Cut the butter into the flour mixture, using a pastry blender or two knives or working with your fingertips, until the mixture looks like fresh crumbs. Add the buttermilk, currants if using, and orange rind. Mix only until the dry ingredients are moistened. Gather the dough into a ball and press so it holds together. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead lightly twelve times. Divide the dough in two and pat each half into a circle 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. In a small bowl combine the cream, cinnamon, and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, stirring to blend. Brush the dough with this glaze. Cut each circle into eight scone shape pieces (circular, or wedge). Place the scones slightly apart on the baking sheet. Bake for about 12 to 15 minutes, or until the tops are browned. Serve hot with butter, jam and tea if desired.

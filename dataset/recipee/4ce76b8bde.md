### Ingredients

 - 1 quart of ice creams, vanilla

 - 1/2 cup of orange juice, raw

 - 12 ounce of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022

### Instructions

With a small ice cream scoop or melon baller, scoop balls of vanilla ice cream onto a cold cookie sheet lined with waxed paper. Place in the freezer to reset the ice cream balls to firm. Put the chocolate in a microwave safe bowl and microwave at medium until liquid, about 1 1/2 minutes. Stop and stir every 30 seconds until melted, be careful not to burn it. Spread the orange drink powder onto a large plate. Roll the ice cream balls in the powder and return them to the cookie sheet. Drizzle the melted chocolate over the ice cream balls. Return to the freezer until ready to serve.

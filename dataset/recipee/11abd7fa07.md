### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 34 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Mix the flour, baking powder and salt in a mixing bowl. Add the oil to the warm water. Add the oil/water mixture to the flour mixture, one tablespoon at a time. Mix the dough after each addition of oil/water. Repeat this process until all the oil/water has been added. Note: The dough will be sticky. Knead the dough on a floured board for 4-5 minutes, adding more flour as needed. Place the dough back in the mixing bowl and cover with a damp towel. Let the dough rest for 20 minutes. Pinch the dough into 12 golf ball-sized balls. Place the balls on a platter or board and cover with the damp cloth. Let the balls rest for 10 minutes. Preheat a cast iron skillet (works best) or other skillet over medium heat. Roll out the balls to a 6- or 7-inch diameter, about 1/8 inch thick. Place one tortilla in the preheated skillet and cook for about 30 seconds. Flip the tortilla over and cook it on the other side. Repeat with remaining tortillas.

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

 - 34 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Melt the 1 stick butter and let cool about 5 minutes. Whisk together the dry ingredients. In a separate bowl, combine the melted butter and the buttermilk, and stir until clumps form. Stir the liquid into the dry ingredients until just incorporated and the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Using a 1/4 cup dry measure, scoop out and drop 12 balls of dough onto the baking sheet (this is easier if you spray the measuring cup with nonstick cooking spray). Bake until the tops are golden brown, about 14 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack. Meanwhile, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and brush the tops of the biscuits with the butter before serving.

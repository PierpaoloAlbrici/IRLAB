Honey Roasted Almonds


Ingredients


 - 2 1/2 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 18 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 14 cup of honey


 - 34 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Preheat your oven to 325F Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment or wax paper. If using parchment, lightly oil it. Combine the sugar and salt in a bowl large enough to accommodate the almonds and set aside. Melt the honey in a large skillet over low to medium heat. Add the almonds and stir until all the nuts are coated with the honey. Spread the nuts in a single layer on the baking sheet and bake for about 10 minutes. Let the almonds cool slightly and toss them in the sugar-salt mixture. Remove the parchment or wax lining from the baking sheet and spread out the almonds on it again to let them cool completely. Transfer to a serving bowl and theyre ready!

Cherry Tomatoes With Tamarind Dressing


Ingredients


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, cumin seed


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, fennel seed


 - 2 teaspoon of tamarinds, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 teaspoon of honey


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 3 cup of cherries, sweet, raw


Instructions: 

Toast cumin and fennel seeds then coarsely crush using a mortar and pestle. Whisk tamarind concentrate into hot water until dissolved, then whisk in honey (to taste), oil, salt, and pepper until blended. Add tomatoes and toasted seeds and toss to coat. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour, then season with salt to taste. (We found if it sat many more hours in the fridge it was not to our tastes at all because the fennel flavour became stronger. ).

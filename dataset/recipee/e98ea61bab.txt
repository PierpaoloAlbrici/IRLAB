Dark English Toffee


Ingredients


 - 1 1/3 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 14 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 tablespoon of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 1 tablespoon of molasses


 - 7 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Combine all of the ingredients in a heavy-bottom saucepan over medium heat. Heat slowly, stirring until the butter has melted and the sugar has dissolved. Increase the heat and bring the mixture to a boil. Cover and gently boil for around 2 minutes. Remove the cover and continue to boil, stirring occasionally, until the mixture reaches 300F on a candy thermometer; it should take 10-15 minutes. Pour the mixture into a buttered 6x6-inch pan, let the toffee cool to the touch and score it into 1-inch squares. Let the toffee cool completely; turn it out onto a board, bread the toffee into pieces and warp them individually in squares of waxed paper. Store at room temperature in an airtight container.

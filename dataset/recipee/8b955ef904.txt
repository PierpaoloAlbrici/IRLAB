Pumpkin Spice Cream Cheese Spread


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of pumpkin, raw


 - 8 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

Instructions: 

In a stand mixer or large bowl with a hand mixer, whip pumpkin and softened cream cheese together until uniform in color. Scrape the edges and mix on low, sprinkling sugar into the mixture. Once sugar is incorporated, stir in the remaining ingredients. Scrape the edges and whip again to ensure a completely smooth homogenous mixture.

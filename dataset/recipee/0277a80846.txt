Asparagus In Its Own Juices Recipe


Ingredients


 - 3/4 pound of asparagus, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

CUT OFF THE TOUGH BOTTOM END of the asparagus and throw away. Peel the stalks with a vegetable peeler. Place asparagus in a skillet or possibly saucepan just large sufficient to hold them lying down and barely cover with cool water. Add in butter and salt and bring to a boil, uncovered, over high heat. Stir the asparagus so it will cook proportionately. The asparagus is done when the water has evaporated, leaving only the concentrated, buttery juice of the asparagus. Grind fresh pepper to taste over the asparagus and arrange on a vegetable platter.

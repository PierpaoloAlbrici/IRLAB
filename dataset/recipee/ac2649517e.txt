Basic Bread Dough


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 3 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 4 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

Place warm water in a warm mixing bowl and add yeast. Stir to dissolve and let stand 3 minutes. Add salt and sugar and stir through. Add flour and olive oil and mix, using hands until you can knead the dough without it sticking to your fingers. Wash and dry hands and remove ball to cutting board. Knead the dough, occasionally dusting with 1 tsp. flour, until a firm, smooth homogenous ball is formed, approximately 15 minutes. Place ball of dough in a lightly-oiled mixing bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel and allow to rise in a warm place until its size is doubled, approximately 2 hours. Punch down and divide into 4 pieces. Dough is now ready for use.

### Ingredients

 - 2 1/2 pound of pork, fresh, loin, country-style ribs, separable lean only, raw

 - 4 tablespoon of honey

 - 1 tablespoon of tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average

 - 1 tablespoon of molasses

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, marjoram, dried

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 12 cup of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry

### Instructions

Cut the ribs in half and set aside. Mix all of the other ingredients together in a bowl. Start with the chicken broth before adding the honey; whisk the honey and tomato paste in, to help them both dissolve. Marinate the meat in the other ingredients, turning to coat everything. Refrigerate for 2-4 hours; overnight is best. Make a pouch out of aluminum foil and place the meat and its marinade inside. Crimp it shut. Place the aluminum foil pouch into a heated 225 degree (Fahrenheit) oven. Roast for 6 hours. Remove, plate, and serve. A good side-dish for these ribs are Native American fry bread, tortillas, or warmed pita bread.

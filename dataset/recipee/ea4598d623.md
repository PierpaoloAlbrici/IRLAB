[ea4598d623](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/breads/my-very-own-cheeseolive-little-biscuits/)

### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 2 cup of cheese, cheddar

 - 3 tablespoon of olives, ripe, canned (small-extra large)

### Instructions

In a medium bowl, place softened butter (you can microwave it for a few seconds to soften it). Add flour and cayenne, stirring with a fork or wooden spoon. Add cheese, mixing for about 35 strokes. Add olives, without draining, mixing pretty thoroughly; its okay if it is a little crumbly. Place by tablespoonfuls (I sometimes use a small cookie scoop), forming slightly, on an ungreased cookie sheet (I dont use the air cookie sheet with these). Place in a 400 degrees F oven for ABOUT 14 minutes or until slightly browned on top. They will be browner on the bottom. Remove from the cookie sheet and place on a wire rack to cool, if that is possible, becasue they are DELICIOUS while very warm! Enjoy, enjoy!

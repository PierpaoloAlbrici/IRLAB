Gourmet's Welsh Rabbit


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of cheese, cheddar


 - 2 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, paprika


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of alcoholic beverage, beer, regular, all


Instructions: 

Combine cheese and next four ingredients; set aside. In medium saucepan, melt butter, then add beer. When well-mixed, and back up to temperature, slowly begin adding in cheese mixture, 1/4-cup at a time, stirring well after each addition. Serving suggestions: fondue-style; on thickly-sliced, toasted, day-old bread (traditional); serve on the bread, then top with a poached egg and diced bacon (Yorkshire rabbit).

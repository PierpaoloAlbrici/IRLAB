### Ingredients

 - 14 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 1 pound of asparagus, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

In a 10-inch skillet over medium heat, toast almonds until golden, shaking skillet occasionally. Remove almonds to a small plate. Meanwhile, hold the base of one asparagus stalk firmly and bend the stalk. The end will break where it becomes tough to eat. Use that stalk as a guide to cut the remaining stalks. If the asparagus is very thick, you may want to use a vegetable peeler to trim the scales. In same skillet, melt the butter or margarine over medium heat and add the asparagus. Cook, uncovered until asparagus in crisp-tender, turning frequently. Place asparagus on a serving platter and sprinkle with salt and almonds.

Easy & Egg-free Baked Cocoa Cookies


Ingredients


 - 70 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched


 - 30 g of cornstarch


 - 40 g of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


 - 30 g of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 2 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Put the mixing bowl on a kitchen scale, add the ingredients, and mix well with a whisk. Add the vegetable oil and milk and mix with a spatula. When it becomes crumbly, cover with plastic wrap and form into a log. Make 7 mm slices. Bake at 170C for 14-15 minutes. Let cool and enjoy! They're crumbly when just baked, but if you let them cool, they'll harden to a nice texture. This is a matcha version.

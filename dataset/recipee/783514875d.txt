 - 215 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 150 g of oats


 - 225 g of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 pinch of salt, table

Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 160C/350F/Gas 4, 10 minutes before baking. Lightly oil a 33 x 23 cm swiss roll tin and line with nonstick baking parchment. Place the flour, rolled oats, the light muscovado sugar, bicarbonate of soda and salt into a bowl and stir well together. Melt the butter and golden syrup together in a heavy-based saucepan and stir until smooth, then add to the oat mixture and mix together thoroughly. Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and press down firmly and level the top. Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until golden. Remove from the oven and leave the flapjack to cool in the tin. Once cool, remove from the tin. Discard the parchment. Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of gently simmering water. Alterntively, melt the chocolate in the microwave according to the manufacturer's instructions. Once the chocolate has melted quickly beat in the cream, then pour over the flapjack. Mark patterns over the chocolate with a fork when almost set. Chill the flapjack in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before cutting into bars. When the chocolate has set, serve. Store in an airtight container for a few days.

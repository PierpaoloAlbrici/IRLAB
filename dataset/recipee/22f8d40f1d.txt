Stove Top Coconut Popcorn


Ingredients


 - 1 tablespoon of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


 - 1/2 cup of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)


 - 2 pinch of salt, table


Instructions: 

Heat the coconut oil in a 3-1/2-quart sauce pan (dont use a shallow pan!) over medium-high heat. Add a single popcorn kernel, put the lid on and wait for the POP! When you hear it, pour the remaining kernels in, forming a single layer on the bottom of your pan. Put a lid on it and shake it often, being careful not burn it! When the popping comes to a slow stop, remove from the heat and slowly take off the lid. Season with kosher salt (you dont need butter because of the oil) and enjoy this healthy and delicious snack!

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of seeds, pumpkin and squash seeds, whole, roasted, without salt

 - 1/2 cup of candies, caramels

 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Evenly spread pumpkin seeds on a large baking sheet covered with parchment paper. The caramel at room temperature is usually a bit thick to pour over the seeds, so heat the caramel in a glass measuring cup for about 1015 seconds in the microwave. With the help of a kitchen spoon, start pouring caramel over the pumpkin seeds, making sure its evenly distributed in a thin layer over the seeds. Sprinkle with salt. Bake at 350 degrees F for 810 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes and start breaking into bite-sized pieces.

[ded3f07451](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/343271-dads-bread-for-the-bread-machine-recipe)

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 3 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

### Instructions

Starting at the beginning of the list, add all the ingredients to the machine. Don't worry about any of the ingredients mixing. Set the machine for a 2 and a half hour cycle. I only have preset times and types of loaves, so I chose rapid loaf, light crust, which runs to two hours and thirty five minutes. Turns out perfectly every time!

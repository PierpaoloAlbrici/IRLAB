Sour Cherry Compote


Ingredients


 - 1 1/4 pound of cherries, sweet, raw


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 tablespoon of cornstarch


 - 2/3 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1/2 teaspoon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Pit cherries over a bowl to catch any juices. Whisk together sugar and cornstarch in a 3-quart saucepan, then add water and any cherry juice, whisking until smooth. Add cherries and bring to a boil over moderate heat, stirring. Boil, stirring, 2 minutes, then drain in a sieve set over a bowl. Return juices to saucepan and simmer, stirring occasionally, until syrup is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in rose water, then pour syrup over cherries in a bowl and cool.

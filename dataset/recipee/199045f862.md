### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 2 pinch of salt, table

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 3 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch

 - 2 teaspoon of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

In a small saucepan, whisk together the coconut milk, salt, sugar, and water. Place over medium heat and bring to a near-simmer, lowering the heat if the coconut milk spits or pops. Give the cornstarch mixture a good stir and add it to the sauce, mixing well. Cook, stirring, for about 30 seconds, or until the sauce thickens; then remove from the heat. Let the sauce cool, uncovered, to concentrate the flavors before serving. It will keep in a tightly closed container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. If you are serving it warm, reheat gently over low heat.

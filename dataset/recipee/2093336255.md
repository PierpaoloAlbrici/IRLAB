### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of nuts, cashew nuts, raw

 - 1 cup of honey

 - 1 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

### Instructions

Line a jelly roll pan with wax paper. Mix all ingredients together in a bowl. Wet or lightly spray your hands with cooking spray to prevent sticking, and roll the mixture into 1-inch balls (I use a cookie scoop). Place them on the wax paper. Freeze for at least 3 hours (or overnight) and enjoy! Store in the freezer.

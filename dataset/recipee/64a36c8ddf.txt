White Chocolate Raspberry Swirl Fondue


Ingredients


 - 6 ounce of raspberries, raw


 - 1 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 1 pound of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

Set aside 1/3 of the raspberries for dipping into the finished fondue. In a blender puree the remaining raspberries. Strain the puree through a fine meshed wire sieve into a small bowl. Discard the seeds. Set the puree aside. In a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the cream to a simmer over medium heat and add the white chocolate. Let stand until the chocolate softens, about 3 minutes. Whisk until smooth. Transfer the fondue to a ceramic fondue pot and keep warm over a burner. Drizzle the raspberry puree over the fondue. Swirl a knife through the puree to create a marble effect.

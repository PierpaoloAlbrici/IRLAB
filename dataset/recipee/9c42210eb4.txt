Easy Easter Egg Bird Nests


Ingredients


 - 12 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 8 ounce of nuts, almonds


 - 1 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 12 ounce of noodles, egg, dry, unenriched


 - 10 ounce of egg substitute, powder


Instructions: 

In a microwave safe bowl, melt chocolate chips and white almond bark. Microwave for a minute at a time, stirring after each minute. Repeat the process until chocolate is melted and smooth. Then add the peanut butter and mix well. Next add the chow mein noodles and stir until all noodles are well coated. Tear off 2 feet of waxed paper. Using a 1/4 cup measure, scoop out some of the chocolate noodle mixture. Drop mixture onto the waxed paper. Use a spoon to finish shaping the nests. Our nests were 3-4 in diameter. Use the back side of a spoon or scoop to make the bowl of each nest. Drop 3-4 malted eggs into each bowl of the nest. When nests have hardened, remove them from the waxed paper and transfer to a pretty serving dish. These are quite festive served atop edible Easter grass.

Homemade Butter


Ingredients


 - 1 quart of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 13 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

1. Put cream in a large bowl and let it sit at room temperature for an hour. 2. Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, beat the cream until it separates. You will first reach soft peaks, then stiff peaks, then a sort of chunky texture. Finally, your cream will separate into a white liquid (buttermilk) and yellow curds (butter). 3. Drain the butter using a sieve set over a small bowl. Reserve the buttermilk for drinking or recipes. 4. Put the butter into a bowl and add some cold water (about 1/4 of a cup). Work the butter and water together with a rubber spatula to separate out as much of the buttermilk as possible. The water will get cloudy. Drain the water and continue to add, work, and drain water until it runs clear. 5. If you want salted butter, add the salt and work in with the rubber spatula. Taste and add more if desired. 5a. (optional) Add some finely chopped parsley and basil to make herb butter or mix in some honey and cinnamon to make sweet butter to spread on muffins or toast. 6. Store in an airtight container in the fridge. For step-by-step photos and descriptions, see the related blog post link.

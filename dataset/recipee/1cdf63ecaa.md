### Ingredients

 - 3 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 12 cup of onions, raw

 - 34 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of sauce, fish, ready-to-serve

 - 1 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

 - 2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 teaspoon of sugars, granulated

 - 2 tablespoon of peppers, sweet, green, raw

 - 1 cup of spices, basil, dried

### Instructions

Heat oil in large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; add garlic & onion. Toss well, and when they begin to release their aroma, add chicken in generous pinches. Toss well, using spatula or slotted spoon, to help meat brown evenly and to break up big chunks to achieve a crumbly texture. Add fish sauce, soy sauce, water, and sugar. Cook 2-3 minutes, tossing now and then, just until meat is cooked and seasonings form a thin, smooth sauce. Add chilies and basil and toss well. Transfer to serving plate and serve hot or warm.

Duck Sauce


Ingredients


 - 2/3 cup of apricots, dried, sulfured, uncooked


 - 2 tablespoon of vinegar, cider


 - 4 teaspoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


Instructions: 

Mix all of the ingredients together in a small bowl. Store in the refrigerator; it will keep for at least a month. Serve this as a dipping sauce for Easy Egg Rolls (page 148) or any time you need a little sweet-and-sour jolt on a stir-fry or saute.

Apple Bread Pudding Recipe


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 3/4 cup of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1 cup of egg, white, raw, fresh


 - 4 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 2 cup of apples, raw, with skin


 - 1 cup of raisins, seeded


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 350F. In a large bowl, combine the lowfat milk, maple syrup, and cinnamon. In another bowl, beat the egg whites till frothy. Add in the egg whites to the lowfat milk mix and stir to combine thoroughly. Add in the bread and toss well. Set aside to soak for 30 min. Mix in the diced apples and raisins and pour into a nonstick or possibly lightly oiled 8x12x2" baking dish. Bake for 45-50 min, or possibly till the top is very brown and crisp. A knife inserted into the middle should come out clean at this point. Serve hot or possibly at room temperature.

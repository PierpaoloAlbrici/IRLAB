Foil Baked Asparagus


Ingredients


 - 200 g of asparagus, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 180 C (360 F). Prepare asparagus by snapping the lower "woody" part of the stem off (if it snaps cleanly you've got the right place; if it is difficult to break try higher up! ), and peel the lower section if they're a bit old or thick. Tear off a large enough piece of aluminium foil to wrap around the bunch of asparagus securely, and place asparagus in foil. Dot with butter and sprinkle lightly with salt. Wrap securely, and then wrap an extra strip of foil around the tip end to protect it. Bake in oven for 25-35 mins, depending on the thickness and age of the asparagus (Mine were done in 30 and I'd say they were fairly average sized). Try to wait until you're ready to serve before you unwrap them, or better still, serve them still wrapped in the foil.

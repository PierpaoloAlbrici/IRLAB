### Instructions

Heat the sesame oil on medium-high in a skillet for about a minute, or just until it starts to smoke. Add the broccoli and cook until it's shiny and bright green, stirring frequently (about 1 minute). Add the veggie stock and salt and cover. Turn to medium and cook about two minutes; the broccoli should be slightly tender but still crunchy. Toss with Sweet and Hot Garlic Sauce and remove from heat. Serve hot, warm, at room temp, cold -- Enjoy!

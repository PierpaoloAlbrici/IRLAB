 - 20 g of sugars, granulated


 - 5 g of salt, table

 - 110 ml of water, bottled, generic

Instructions: 

Put all of the ingredients in the bread maker and start the bread dough course. Once the first rise has completed, divide the dough into 12 pieces, make them into round shapes, cover with a tightly-wrung towel and let sit for 15 minutes. Make the dough into a teardrop shape. Place the small end closest to you and use a rolling pin to extend. Roll up from the small end, and then place on a baking pan with the seam facing down. Spray with water and allow to rise for a second time. Use your oven's fermentation function for 40 minutes. Preheat your oven to 190C and bake for 15 minutes. If you divide the dough up into 6 pieces, you can make hamburger buns! Wiener Rolls Corn Rolls

### Ingredients

 - 225 g of oats

 - 60 g of seeds, sunflower seed kernels, dried

 - 60 g of nuts, almonds

 - 60 g of nuts, hazelnuts or filberts

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 85 ml of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 85 g of apricots, dried, sulfured, uncooked

### Instructions

Heat the oven to 170 degrees C/Gas mark 5. In a large bowl mix oats, sunflower seeds, almonds and hazlenuts. In a separate bowl combine the honey, oil, water, vanilla extract and cinnamon. I find putting this in the microwave for a minute heats it sufficiently to mix the ingredients. Add liquid to the dry ingredients and mix well. Spread out on a large baking tray and bake in the oven for 30/40 minutes. You will need to stir/turn it occasionally until evenly browned. I wait until it is done then turn off the oven and leave the door open. This way it seems to fully dry out and stays crisp for longer. When cool add the apricots, cut into thin slivers. Mix and store in an airtight tub. A nice alternative is to use pecan nuts instead of hazlenuts. Do crush/chop the nuts yourself though as, if you buy the uniformly shop bought chopped ones, the texture is all wrong.

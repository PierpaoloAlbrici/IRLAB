Holly-Marilyn's Snack Mix


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 4 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt


 - 1 cup of pretzels, soft, unsalted


 - 14 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 4 tablespoon of sauce, worcestershire


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, onion powder


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


Instructions: 

Add cereal, pretzels and nuts to a crock pot set on HIGH. In a medium bowl, add butter, worchestershire sauce and all seasonings. Microwave this bowl for about a minute or so until butter is melted. Mix up well with a spoon. Pour this hot mixture over the crock pot ingredients. Set your timer for 60 minutes. Mix every 10 minutes so that the snack mix does not stick to itself, and the liquids are always distributed evenly. When the hour is up, set crock pot on low. Now set a timer for 20 minutes. I can not stress this enough: mix often! -- every ten minutes if possible! Delicious and addictive!

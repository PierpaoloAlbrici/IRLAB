Instructions: 

1. Place nuts in a large skillet. Toast over medium heat 5-7 minutes or until nuts start to turn a light golden brown, stirring occasionally. 2. Stir in the oats, oat bran, flax seed, and salt. 3. In a small bowl, stir together the syrup, vanilla, honey, water and butter. Drizzle over the nuts and stir until nut mixture is coated. Press the mixture together with a spoon to form chunks if you like larger pieces of granola. 4. Cook for 25-35 minutes or until oats turn a light golden brown. Stir every 5 to 10 minutes to prevent burning. 5. Spread granola out on a paper towel to cool. Store in an airtight container.

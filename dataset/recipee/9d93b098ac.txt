Strawberry Sorbet


Ingredients


 - 23 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 23 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 5 cup of strawberries, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

In a small saucepan, heat up the water and sugar over medium low heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Turn off the heat and let it come to room temperature. This makes a simple syrup that we will use to sweeten up the sorbet. Puree the berries in a blender or with an immersion blender. At this point you can strain out the seeds if you like, but I left mine in. Add the lemon juice and mix together. Once the simple syrup has cooled off to the point it isnt hot anymore, mix it in with the pureed berries and refrigerate until the liquid has become refrigerator temperature. Now, following the directions of your ice cream maker, pour in the strawberry goodness. My sorbet was done in 25 minutes. At this point it will be the consistency of soft serve. Eat it now, or put in a freezer safe container and freeze until ready to serve. Enjoy!

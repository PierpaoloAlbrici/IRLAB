Homemade Ginger Beer


Ingredients


 - 1 quart of water, bottled, generic


 - 4 ounce of spices, ginger, ground


 - 1/2 ounce of lime juice, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, brown


Instructions: 

Finely grate ginger. In a pot, bring water to a boil, and shut off heat. Add grated ginger and lime juice. Cover and let stand for one hour. Add the light brown sugar and stir well to dissolve. Strain the liquid through a fine strainer. Let cool. Important: When you are straining the ginger through the strainer, take a spoon or ladle and firmly press down on the ginger to extract its flavor. The strongest part of the ginger essence is still hiding in there, and needs to be pressed out. Pour the cool liquid through a funnel into a covered bottle or storage container. Shake well before using. Ginger beer can be stored for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator. Try to use when fresh, as the strength of the ginger fades each day, and the ginger beer eventually starts to ferment. Shake well before using.

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of spices, basil, dried

 - 12 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

### Instructions

Basil -- This is the key - blanch your basil leaves. Bring a small pot of water up to a medium boil and add the leaves for 20 seconds. Remove immediately from the pot and add to a small bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process and to retain the bright green color. It only takes a minute to cool off the basil. Remove from the water bath to a paper towel and make sure you let the basil dry off before you make the oil. Oil -- Add your basil and garlic to the blender and pulse a couple of times to start the puree. Then slowly drizzle in the olive oil with the blender on until smooth and creamy. Just enjoy it!

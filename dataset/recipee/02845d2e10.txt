Currant Griddle Scones


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/4 cup of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


 - 1/4 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 2/3 cup of currants, zante, dried


 - 1/4 cup of nuts, walnuts, english


Instructions: 

Combine the first 4 (dry) ingredients in a mixing bowl and stir together. Work the margarine into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or the tines of a fork until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add enough rice milk to hold the dough together, working it together with your hands. Work the currants and walnuts in with your hands, then turn the dough out onto a well-floured board and knead briefly. Form the dough into a ball, then roll out to a thickness of about 1/4 inch. Cut the dough into 2-inch rounds with a cookie cutter or the rim of a glass. Gather up any leftover dough, roll out, and cut until all the dough has been used up. Heat a griddle or large nonstick skillet that has been sprayed with cooking oil spray. Cook the scones over medium heat or until golden brown on both sides. Cool on a rack and serve warm.

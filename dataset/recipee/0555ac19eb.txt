Fudgy Brownies


Ingredients


 - 8 ounce of tofu, raw, regular, prepared with calcium sulfate


 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 23 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350F. Grease and flour a 9-inch square baking pan. In food processor or blender, process tofu until pureed. In small saucepan, mix 1/3 cup flour with water until smooth. Stir in pureed tofu until blended. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 3 minutes. Transfer to medium bowl and let cool completely. Add sugar, salt and vanilla and mix until well blended. In small bowl, mix cocoa and oil, then stir into tofu mixture. Stir in remaining 1 1/2 cups flour and baking powder until blended. Scrape mixture into prepared pan. Bake until top is dry and springs back lightly when gently pressed, about 25 minutes. Set pan on wire rack and let cool, then cut into bars.

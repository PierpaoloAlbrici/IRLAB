### Ingredients

 - 150 g of pancakes, plain, dry mix, complete (includes buttermilk)

 - 30 g of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Add the pancake mix to a bowl, and add the melted margarine or butter. Mix well. Once mixed together, use your hands to make into round shapes, or use a cookie cutter. Bake in the oven at 180C for 15 minutes and they're complete! I recommend watching them carefully as they bake.

### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of strawberries, raw

 - 1 cup of pomegranate juice, bottled

 - 13 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

### Instructions

Place 6 small dessert dishes in the freezer to chill. In a food processor, combine frozen berries, and pomegranate juice. Process until smooth. Transfer to a bowl, cover and place in the freezer for 1 hour to firm. Serve drizzled with cream in chilled dishes. If sorbet has been stored longer and has become hard, let it soften briefly in refrigerator before serving. Chunks of frozen bananas are good for adding a fat-free, cream texture to any frozen fruit blend.

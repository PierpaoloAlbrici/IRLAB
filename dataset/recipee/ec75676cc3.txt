Ingredients


 - 7 ounce of spices, ginger, ground


 - 7 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 7 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

Blitz the gingerbread cookies in a food processor until nice and fine. Reserve about 1 tablespoon for sprinkling and pour the rest into a large bowl. Add the cream cheese and work together until nicely combined. You should have a sticky but workable dough. Form it into small balls and place on a baking sheet lined with grease-proof paper. Pop in the freezer for 30 minutes to harden. Melt chocolate in a bain marie and then dip each truffle in. Place back on the baking tray and sprinkle each with a little of the reserved gingerbread crumbsdo this as soon as you coat them in chocolate because they harden really quickly and the crumbs wont stick! Put in the fridge until ready to eat. Enjoy!

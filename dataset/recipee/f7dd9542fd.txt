Blueberry Cordial


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 3 cup of blueberries, raw


 - 2 cup of alcoholic beverage, distilled, vodka, 80 proof


Instructions: 

Rinse a heat-proof 2-quart jar with boiling water, drain it, and combine sugar, blueberries and vodka in it. Seal jar tightly and let cordial stand in a cool, dark place, shaking the jar occasionally, for two months. Strain the cordial through a very fine sieve, lined with a triple thickness of rinsed and squeezed cheesecloth, into a bowl and transfer it to a decanter. Serve the cordial as an after-dinner drink or with tonic over ice as a cocktail.

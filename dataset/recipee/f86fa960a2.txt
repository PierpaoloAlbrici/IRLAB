Iranian Flatbread


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl. I use my kitchenaid. Slowly add the warm water and mix to a dough consistency. Knead 5-10 times on a floured board and place back in bowl to rise in a warm place. I oil the bowl first to keep from sticking. Allow to rise in a warm place for about an hour. Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Divide dough in half and roll out each piece into a rectangular slab approximately 1/4 - 1/2" thick. Bake in preheated 500 degree oven on the top shelf until nicely browned. Flip over to the other side and do the same. Repeat with the second slab. I brush with a small amount of melted butter to keep soft. Cover with a tea cloth to keep warm until ready to eat.

[2f676547b7](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/appetizers-and-snacks/oatmeal-raisin-granola-bars/)

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of oats

 - 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/4 cup of seeds, sunflower seed kernels, dried

 - 1/4 cup of raisins, seeded

 - 18 cup of wheat germ, crude

 - 1/2 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 1/2 cup of honey

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine all of the ingredients together (except the honey) until everything is evenly mixed and well blended together. Add the honey. I recommend spraying your hands with Pam spray before incorporating everything together. It is much easier if you use your hands to combine everything. Spread mixture into an 8 x 8 lightly greased oven safe dish. To spread out the mixture evenly and with minimal mess, use wax paper to spread and flatten the granola bar mixture. Bake in a 350 degrees F oven for 18-20 minutes. Allow to cool, and then slice into 8 individual bars.

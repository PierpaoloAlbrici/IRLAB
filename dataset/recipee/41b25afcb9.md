Preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Coat a cast-iron skillet with cooking spray and place in the oven while preparing the spice rub. Combine the sugar, five-spice powder, garlic powder and salt in a small bowl. Sprinkle half the mixture evenly over the surface of the steak, then pat or rub it into the meat. Turn the steak over, and repeat on the second side. Place the steak in the hot cast-iron skillet. Cook 6 to 7 minutes on each side, depending on desired degree of doneness. Remove the steak from the oven, and let it rest on the carving board for 3 to 5 minutes. Cut it across the grain on the diagonal in thin strips.

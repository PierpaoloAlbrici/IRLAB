Microwave Nut Brittle


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of nuts, walnuts, english


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 cup of syrups, corn, light


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Chop the nuts or seeds if they are large; otherwise, leave them whole. Put them into a 4-quart glass bowl with all other ingredients except the baking soda and vanilla extract. Stir in 3/4 cup water. Heat in a microwave oven on high power for 5 minutes. Using oven mitts or potholders, carefully transfer the bowl to a countertop and stir with a heat-resistant spatula. Repeat 2 or 3 more times, until the syrup thickens and the nuts begin to stick together. Then heat for 1-minute periods, stirring in between, until the syrup begins to turn light golden brown. Line a baking sheet with foil. Add the baking soda and vanilla extract to the syrup and stir vigorously. Quickly pour the mixture out onto the baking sheet and use the spatula to spread it as thin as possible. Allow to cool to room temperature, then peel off the foil and break the brittle into pieces. Store in an airtight container.

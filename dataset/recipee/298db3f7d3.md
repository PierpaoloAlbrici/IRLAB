[298db3f7d3](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/condiments/hard-anise-caramel-dipping-sauce/)

### Ingredients

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, anise seed

 - 2 cup of sugars, brown

### Instructions

This goes great on my Lemony Anise Biscotti. See my TastyKitchen recipe box for the recipe. Melt butter in sauce pan over medium low heat; add anise flavoring. Add brown sugar to melted anise butter. Stir constantly until all brown sugar had melted and has completely dissolved. Its very hot make sure to not get any on your skin or it will burn! Here is the tricky part, you can either dip your biscotti into the sauce like I did or drizzle it over them on a baking sheet. Let cool completely before touching. If you are feeling extra fancy that day; while the caramel sauce is still hot and gooey sprinkle with some crushed cookies and or nuts! Super fab! !

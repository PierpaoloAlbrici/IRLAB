Beginner-Friendly Easy Strawberry Jam


Ingredients


 - 300 g of strawberries, raw

Roughly chop the strawberries or keep them whole. Put the strawberries and the sugar in a pot and let sit for 15 minutes. Turn on the heat. When it starts to boil, simmer for 15 minutes, taking care not to let it burn. Lastly, add the lemon juice and turn off the heat. This photo shows the strawberries right after the heat has been turned off. This is what it will look like when cooled.

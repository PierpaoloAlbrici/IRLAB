### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of potatoes, raw, skin

 - 3 cup of leeks, (bulb and lower leaf-portion), raw

 - 8 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Peel and slice potatoes. Carefully wash the leeks to get all the grit out, then cut up the white part and a little bit of the pale green part. Discard the dark green part, or use to make vegetable stock. Put all ingredients in a large pot and boil for 30 to 45 minutes or until tender. Mash vegetables with a fork or blend in a blender, depending on the consistency you prefer. The soup is a little pale, so you may want to garnish with chopped parsley or chives. Clayton recommends adding 3 tablespoons of unsalted butter, but I've never missed it. My grandmother also adds 2 teaspoons chicken bouillon, which gives it a good flavor.

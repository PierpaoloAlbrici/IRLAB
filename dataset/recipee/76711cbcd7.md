### Ingredients

 - 90 g of dates, deglet noor

 - 60 g of nuts, cashew nuts, raw

 - 3 teaspoon of honey

 - 60 g of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

### Instructions

Combine the dates, cashew nuts, honey and 3/4 of the coconut in a blender or food processor. Grind everything into small pieces. Put the rest of the shredded coconut on a plate and make your hands a little wet. This will make sure the mixture wont stick to your hands. Make evenly sized balls (1 inch) and roll them in the coconut on the plate. Now you have 2 options: You can devour them straightaway. Or put them in the freezer for 20 minutes before you devour them (this will make them even better). The honey will give the truffles a soft-crunchy texture. Enjoy!

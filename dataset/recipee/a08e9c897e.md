### Ingredients

 - 3 pound of sauce, fish, ready-to-serve

 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 3 cup of pancakes, plain, dry mix, complete (includes buttermilk)

 - 2 cup of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, basil, dried

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

### Instructions

Cut fish fillets in half, making triangular shape. Cover with lowfat milk and lemon juice and chill 3-4 hrs. Drain off lowfat milk. Dip fillets in flour to coat each piece lightly. Let dry on a cookie sheet, making sure pcs don't tough. Add in oil to deep fryer or possibly heavy pan to a depth of at least 3 inches. Heat oil to 425 . Combine pancake mix, basil, pepper, garlic salt and sufficient soda to make a thick batter, about the consistency of buttermilk. Dip floured fillets in batter and add in to the warm oil one at a time. Fry 4-5 min. Remove filets to cookie sheet, again, not letting them touch and keep hot in a 250 oven. Deep fry remaining filets, keeping the depth of the oil at least 3 inches. NOTE: Don't heap fish as thiscreates steam in the oven and makes coating soft.

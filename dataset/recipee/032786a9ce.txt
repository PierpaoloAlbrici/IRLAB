Sesame Cardamom Tea Cookies


Ingredients


 - 1 1/3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cardamom


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 14 cup of sugars, brown


 - 12 cup of seeds, sesame butter, tahini, from roasted and toasted kernels (most common type)


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 2 tablespoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground


Instructions: 

Combine flour, cardamom, salt, and baking powder. Set aside. Mix the sugars and butter ( or margarine) over medium speed until fluffy. Mix in the tahini (make sure to mix well), then the vanilla, sesame seeds, and ginger (if using). Over low speed, add flour mixture. Dough should be a bit crumbly (much like shortbread dough). Cover dough with plastic wrap and chill for about an hour. Preheat oven to 350. Shape dough into small balls (about 1 inch or 15 grams). Arrange onto a baking sheet (I use baking mats, but parchment also works). Using a glass, press the cookies down into discs. You may need to dip the glass in water to prevent the cookies from sticking to the glass. Bake about 8 minutes until the edges are slightly browned. Cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack.

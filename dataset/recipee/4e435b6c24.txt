Great Granola


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of nuts, cashew nuts, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 2 pound of oats


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground


 - 2/3 cup of sugars, brown


 - 5 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 to 3 cup of raisins, seeded


 - 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 cup of honey


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 325. In a small sauce pan, melt the butter. Add the brown sugar, honey and vanilla. Heat and stir until well blended. In a very large bowl, combine the oats, nuts, dried fruit, cinnamon and nutmeg or mace. Mix well. Stir in the butter mixture until thoroughly blended. Spread the oats evenly onto 2 ungreased baking pans. I use jelly roll pans or cookie sheets with a rim. Bake for 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes. Make sure to stir up all of the granola and move it around so it doesn't get over browned. Remove from the oven. Let cool right on the pans. Store in an air tight container.

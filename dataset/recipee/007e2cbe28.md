### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of corn, sweet, white, raw

 - 1 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Preheat a cast-iron griddle over medium-high or an electric griddle set to 422F. Put the masa in the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the hook attachment. Beat at low speed while gradually adding 1 cup of the water. Add as much of the remaining water 1 tablespoon at a time as needed to make a soft and smooth dough. The dough is the right consistency when a small piece of it can be rolled into a ball between your palms without the dough cracking. Beat for 1 minute more, then use the dough immediately. Roll 3 level tablespoons (1 1/2 ounces) of the dough between your palms to make a 2-inch ball. Line the bottom plate of tortilla press with a circle of plastic (cut from a plastic grocery store bag). Center the dough over the plastic, top with a second circle of plastic, and press the dough out ot a smooth circle, wiggling the handle of the press gently to flatten the dough evenly. Lift the top of the press, rotate the dough circle so the front of the circle is now at the back, and press again. (Most tortilla presses will make tortillas that are slightly thicker on one side than the other. Rotating the tortilla after the first press will make an evenly thick tortilla that will cook evenly.) As soon as the tortilla is pressed, place it on the griddle. Cook until the underside start to turn light golden brown in spots, about 2 minutes. Turn and cook unitl the tortilla puffs up. Repeat with the remaining masa, transferring the hot tortillas to a napkin-lined basket if serving them immediately or stacking them on a plate if using them for another recipe. Once you get the hang of it, youll be able to press more tortilla while those on the griddle continue cooking.

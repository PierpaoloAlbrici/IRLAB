### Ingredients

 - 500 g of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 300 ml of water, bottled, generic

 - 7 g of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Mix the flour, salt and yeast together and then stir in the warm water and olive oil to make a soft dough. Transfer to a floured surface and knead for five minutes until springy, using extra flour if it's too sticky. Shape into a ball, brush over a little more oil, cover and leave to rise in a warm place until it doubles in size. This should take about an hour. Knead again on a floured surface and divide into six pieces, rolling each chunk into a ball. Leave to rise for 10 minutes. Preheat the oven to 240 C or 475 F. Meanwhile, roll the balls flat until they're only 3mm or 1/8 of an inch thick and about 17cm or 7 inches across. Place on greased baking sheets, cover with a tea towel and let rest for 30 minutes. Spray the dough with water and bake for two minutes. Check to make sure they haven't gone hard and if not, bake for a couple minutes more. You want them firm but not hard or brown. Remove from the oven and serve immediately with dips or as a wrap for all sorts of fillings. Great with kebabs! If you must serve them later, you can brush them lightly with oil and then reheat them by briefly heating them in a frying pan.

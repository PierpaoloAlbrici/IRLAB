### Ingredients

 - 13 cup of honey

 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 3 cup of honey

 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

### Instructions

In a saucepan, bring the water and honey to a simmer over medium high heat, stirring until the honey dissolves completely. Let cool. Stir in the green tea, and lemon juice, then pour into a very cold 13x9-inch pan and carefully set in the freezer. Stir with a fork every 45-60 minutes, breaking up the any ice cyrstals that may have formed, until the mixture is firm. Scrape with a fork and serve in glasses, garnished with a slice of lemon.

Mustard Scallion Potato Salad


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 1 teaspoon of vinegar, cider


 - 2 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 1/4 cup of onions, spring or scallions (includes tops and bulb), raw


Instructions: 

In a saucepan cover potatoes with salted cold water by 1 inch and simmer, covered, until just tender, about 15 minutes. Drain potatoes well in a colander and, when just cool enough to handle, halve. Transfer hot potatoes to a bowl and immediately toss with vinegar. Add remaining ingredients and salt and pepper to taste and gently toss until combined well. Serve potato salad warm or at room temperature.

[5ee554369b](http://www.food.com/recipe/maple-pecan-granola-502092)

### Ingredients

 - 6 1/2 cup of oats

 - 2 1/2 cup of nuts, pecans

 - 12 cup of seeds, sunflower seed kernels, dried

 - 14 cup of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

 - 34 cup of syrup, maple, canadian

 - 34 cup of oil, canola

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400F Combine the oats, pecans, seeds, syrup, and oil in a large bowl until well blended. Spread in an even layer in a large roasting pan and place in oven. Use a large spatula to turn and stir the granola every 5 minutes to ensure even browning and to prevent the edges from burning. Bake until golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, cover a square of your counter (about twice the size of the roasting pan) with aluminum foil. Remove the granola from the oven and carefully scoop the mixture onto the foil. Let cool completely, then break into chunks of desired size. Store two to three weeks in an airtight container. (Makes about 10 cups, or about 20 servings). VARIATIONS:. If you can't find toasted sesame seeds in the Asian food section of your grocery story, regular white sesame seeds are fine.

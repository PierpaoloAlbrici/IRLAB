Roasted Two-Tone Potatoes


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 pound of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 1 1/2 pound of sweet potato, raw, unprepared


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 3/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 3/4 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 400F. Coat large roasting pan with cooking spray. Peel all potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch-thick pieces about 1 1/2 inches long. In large bowl, combine potatoes, oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt; toss to coat. Spread potatoes in prepared roasting pan. Roast potatoes, stirring every 10 minutes or so, until browned and fork-tender, about 40 minutes. Stir in nutmeg toward end of roasting. Season with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Serve hot.

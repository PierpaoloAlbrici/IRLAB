Cream Cheese Pie Dough


Ingredients


 - 2 teaspoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 teaspoon of vinegar, cider


 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt


 - 4 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard


Instructions: 

Combine water and vinegar in a small bowl. Combine flour and salt in another bowl. Using a pastry blender or your fingers, cut butter and cream cheese into flour mixture until mixture resembles coarse meal, with some larger pieces remaining. (Alternatively, pulse ingredients in a food processor.) Add water mixture to dough in a slow, steady stream, stirring (or pulsing), until mixture just begins to hold together. Turn out onto plastic, and wrap. Press dough into a disk using a rolling pin. Refrigerate until firm, 1 hour or up to 1 day. (Dough can be frozen up to 3 months; thaw in the refrigerator before using.)

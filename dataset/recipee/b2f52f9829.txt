Cook butter, sugar, water, vanilla and salt in a heavy saucepan over high heat, stirring mixture constantly, 15-18 minutes or until a candy thermometer registers 310F. Remove from heat and immediately pour over almonds (do not scrape the pan). Sprinkle immediately with chocolate morsels and spread evenly to 1/2 inch from sides. Sprinkle with ground walnuts. Let stand until firm. Break into small pieces and store in an airtight container. (The toffee mixture will not coat the entire baking sheet).

Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 400. Sift together the flour, salt, baking powder, and cinnamon. Add the butter and rub it in until the mixture resembles fine bread crumbs. Mix in the sugar and peaches gently to avoid crushing the fruit. Add the milk gradually, stirring until you have a soft dough. Knead gently on a floured surface for about 2 minutes, then roll out until 3/4 inch thick. Use a biscuit cutter or a jar lid to cut approximately 2 1/2 inch rounds. Place on greased baking sheet. Combine brown sugar and cinnamon for topping. Brush tops of biscuit with milk and sprinkle cinnamon brown sugar mix on top. Bake at 400 for 15-20 minutes until golden brown. Cool, split and serve with butter, fruit, or whipped cream.

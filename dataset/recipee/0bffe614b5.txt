Honey Wholemeal Scones


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 20 g of butter, without salt


 - 14 cup of honey


 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Combine dry ingredients in a bowl. Rub in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in honey and add as much milk as needed to form a soft dough. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead lightly. Pat down to desired thickness and cut out scones of desired size (I use a 7.5 cm glass). Bake at 220 C for about 8 minutes.

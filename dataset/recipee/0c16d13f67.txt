Instructions: 

Lorne Sausage. Put everything in big bowl together and give it a really good mix by hand. Then ideally put the mix into a loaf tin or rectangular pan about 10" x 4" x 3". Put the sausage meat block in the freezer for a little while until it's just starting to set. Remove it from the tin and cut the sausage block into the thickness of slices you prefer. Put the slices, separated by cling film, into freezer bags and put them back in the freezer. To Serve. When required, defrost and grill or fry in a little fat or oil until brown and crispy on the outside, and cooked through. Serve with bacon and eggs for breakfast. Serve with chips and baked beans for a larger meal. Traditionally served in a bread roll ("roll on sausage" in Scotland) as a morning-after recovery aid, laced with HP Brown Sauce.

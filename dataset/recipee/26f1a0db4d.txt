Put everything in the bread maker. Put the yeast in the yeast compartment. Use the bread course setting and set it to quick bake. If you can choose the crust colour, set it to light or standard. I baked it in a Rehrucken mould. See. If you use a Rehrucken mould, you can cut it easily along the lines.

[db31477676](http://www.food.com/recipe/no-bake-chow-mein-noodle-cookies-124349)

### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of syrups, corn, light

 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

 - 1 cup of noodles, egg, dry, unenriched

### Instructions

Bring sugar and syrup to a full boil in a heavy pan. Remove from heat at once. (Over cooking will make a hard cookie.) Add peanut butter and noodles. Mix thoroughly. Drop into rounded mounds onto waxed paper. Let set for at least 15 minutes. NOTE: I usually add more noodles for a crunchier cookie. I add a half cup or so at a time, stirring them in to make sure they will still stick together before deciding whether to add more or to stop. PREP time includes cooling.

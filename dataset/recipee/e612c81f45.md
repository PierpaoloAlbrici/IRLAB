### Ingredients

 - 1 gallon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 teaspoon of vinegar, distilled

### Instructions

Boil the milk in a saucepan. Add the vinegar and watch the milk curdle (water seperates from milk fat). Drain out the water in a sieve or cloth. Put it in a cloth and squeeze out as much water as you can. Spread and flatten the paneer (make a square). Make sure the ends are tucked inches. Wrap the cloth on top and put some paper towels on top. Add some newspapers to the pile and put some heavy weight on top of it. Make sure the weight is somewhat equal on the paneer square. Leave it overnight. And cut into small pieces and store it in the freezer to use whenever you want.

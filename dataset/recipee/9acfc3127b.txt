Kittencal's Easy Stir and Drop Cheese Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 2 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 34 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 34 cup of cheese, cheddar


 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Set oven to 425 degrees F (400 degrees F for air-convection oven). Generously grease a medium baking sheet or line with parchment paper. In a large bowl combine the flour with the next 4 dry ingredients, then mix in the cheese. Melt 1/2 cup butter in the microwave or on top of the stove, allow to cool at room temperature for 5 minutes while chilling the buttermilk. Place the buttermilk in the the freezer for 5-7 minutes or until very cold but not frozen (the buttermilk needs to be very cold before adding in the melted butter). Mix in the 1/2 cup melted butter to cold buttermilk; stir until butter forms small clumps (stir for about 1 to 1-1/2 minutes). Add the milk mixture to the dry ingredients; stir gently using a spatula until the mixture pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Scoop 1/4-cup batter onto prepared baking sheet spacing the dough about 1-1/2 inches apart. Bake for about 12-14 minutes or until golden brown. Brush the hot biscuits with the remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter.

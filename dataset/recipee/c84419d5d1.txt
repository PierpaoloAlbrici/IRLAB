Caramel Cream


Ingredients


 - 60 g of sugars, granulated


 - 60 g of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


Instructions: 

Warm the sugar in a pot over medium heat (don't add any water). The sugar will change color when it starts to melt. When the shade of the sugar matches what is shown here in the photo, shake the pot well to even out the colors. When it has become light brown, add the cream in three batches, stirring each time over low heat. It's nice with ice cream or cake. It's also good mixed into cake dough.

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 12 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Mix all ingredients together until just blended. Line a 9" X 9" baking pan with foil. Spray lightly with non-stick spray. Press dough into pan. Poke with a fork or drag fork across the top to make a pattern. Bake for 35-40 minutes. Remove BEFORE cookie gets browned. It will continue to cook a bit after removal. Carefully remove from the pan by lifting the foil right out of the pan. On a flat surface, cut the cookie into small bites sized pieces while it is still hot. If you wait too long, the cookie will only crumble.

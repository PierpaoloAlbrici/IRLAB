### Ingredients

 - 2 pound of beans, snap, green, raw

 - 2 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 12 tablespoon of salt, table

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 400F Wash, dry well, and trim green beans. Put green beans on a baking sheet, and drizzle with olive oil (alternately, use an olive-oil spray). Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Ensure all the beans are evenly coated, and spread them out into 1 layer. Roast for 20-25 minutes, stirring the beans after 15 minutes, until beans are fairly brown in spots and somewhat shriveled. Serve hot or at room temperature.

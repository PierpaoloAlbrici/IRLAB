Sally's Norwegian Lefse


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 14 cup of butter, without salt


 - 12 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


Instructions: 

Mix the first 4 ingredients together. Then add the flour, mixing thoroughly and adding a little extra flour if the dough seems too moist. If using a pancake griddle, divide dough into egg-sized balls(if using a large lefse grill, larger balls will be needed. ). Chill the dough-balls for 30 minutes. Roll out each ball on a pastry cloth until very thin. Bake on a griddle or a lefse grill set at 400 - 500 degrees, until small brown spots appear on the surface. Then, turn and bake the other side until spots appear. Cover with a towel or waxed paper after baking, to keep soft. Serve buttered, and sprinkled with brown or granulated sugar.

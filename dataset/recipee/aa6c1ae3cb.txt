Super Gulf Coast Cocktail Sauce


Ingredients


 - 14 cup of catsup


 - 1 teaspoon of horseradish, prepared


 - 1 tablespoon of sauce, worcestershire


 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

Mix all ingredients together in a small bowl. Taste. If it tastes off (I say this cause I dont really measure, just put things in till they taste good) then may need to add a touch more lemon or wostershire. If you like really spicy, a little bit more horseradish. If too watery looking may need to add some more ketchup. Enjoy!

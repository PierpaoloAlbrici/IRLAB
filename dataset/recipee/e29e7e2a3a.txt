Aunt Martha's Peanut Butter Fudge Recipe


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Mix sugar and peanut butter together a bit and then add in lowfat milk. Cook very slowly, low heat (it burns), stirring occasionally, watch out as it may stick to the bottom of the pan- when droplets from the pan form a soft ball in cool water, one you can pick up in your fingers-stick the pan in a sink of ice cool water and beat with a spoon till thick and shiny. Pour onto wax paper or possibly buttered plate.

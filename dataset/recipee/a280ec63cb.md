### Ingredients

 - 3 pound of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw

### Instructions

Select lean cuts of meat. Remove any fat around the edges. Flank steak, brisket or possibly round steak can be used. I use both front shoulders from deer. For greatest tenderness slice very thinly, against the grain and cut into strips, no more than 1/4 inch thick. The following recipe is for about 3 pounds of meat. I do not weigh or possibly measure, I approximate. Marinate for at least 12 hrs, the longer the better. After meat has marinated blot dry with paper towels.

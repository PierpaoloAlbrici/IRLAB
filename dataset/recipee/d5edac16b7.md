### Ingredients

 - 125 g of nuts, hazelnuts or filberts

 - 120 g of honey

 - 120 g of butter, without salt

 - 2 tablespoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

### Instructions

Get the hazelnuts as finely ground as possible. My final product was gritty because I couldn't get them powdered enough. It doesn't hurt the taste but if anyone figures out how to make them finer, email me. Melt the butter. Combine the melted butter, cocoa, honey and powdered hazelnuts and mix. Put in some kind of container and keep in the fridge.

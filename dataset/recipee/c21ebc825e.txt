Berry Flavored Vinegar Recipe


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of vinegar, red wine


 - 4 cup of goji berries, dried


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


Instructions: 

Rinse and drain 4 c. fresh berries. Hull and slice strawberries. Hull small berries. If you like, set aside 1/4 c. for display in the vinegar bottle. Combine vinegar, fruit and honey in a 2 to 3 qt pan. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, till cold (up to 2 hrs). Pour liquid through fine strainer into a bowl or possibly pyrex measure with a lip (for pouring). Throw away pulp/residue. Pour vinegar through a funnel into a 1 qt bottle, plain or possibly decorative. Close tightly. Let stand at least 1 day. Use or possibly keep at room temperature up to 4 months. If an opaque film develops on surface, you can either spoon it off or possibly, to preserve clarity of vinegar, pour through a fine strainer into a pan and bring to a boil. Cold. Wash the bottle. Refill with vinegar. Store as before. Makes about 1 qt.

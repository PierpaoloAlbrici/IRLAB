 - 14 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 425 degrees. In a small bowl,sift the flour,brown sugar,baking powder,baking soda,and salt. In another bowl, combine the potatoes,buttermilk,butter, and honey. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients just until moistened. Turn onto a lightly floured surface knead 8 to 10 times then pat ( I prefer to pat out the dough) or roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut with a floured 2 1/2 inch biscuit cutter ( I shaped the dough into a rectangle and cut into 6 equal sized squares). Place 1 inch apart onto an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 8 to 12 minutes or until golden brown.

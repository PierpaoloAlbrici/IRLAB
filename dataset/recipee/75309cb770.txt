Burn Rice


Ingredients


 - 1 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Put the rice and oil to fry in a small pan at high heat, stirring from time to time, until golden (about 5 minutes). At the same time put the water to boil. When the water is boiling, add it to the rice (take care, it will bubble violently). Add the salt. Turn the heat to low and put the lid loosely on the pan. Let it simmer for 12-15 minutes or until all the water is absorbed. Remove from the heat and let it wait covered for 5-10 minutes. Serve as a side dish to any meat or with beans.

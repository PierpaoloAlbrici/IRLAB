Ingredients


 - 3 kg of chicken, broilers or fryers, wing, meat and skin, raw


 - 150 ml of sauce, peppers, hot, chili, mature red, canned


 - 100 ml of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 150 ml of sauce, peppers, hot, chili, mature red, canned


 - 50 ml of butter, without salt


 - 50 ml of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

Take a block of unsalted butter, place it in a heavy saucepan, and melt slowly over a low heat. Remove the pan from the heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Skim the foam from the top, and slowly pour the melted butter into a container, discarding the milky solids in the bottom of pan. Pour in the lemon juice and mix thoroughly. Pour into a ramekin to serve. Butterfly the chicken wings by making a slit to the bone down the middle of each and spreading the meat out from there. Mix the peri peri marinade with the olive oil and pour liberally over the chicken. Marinate for 6 to 36 hours in a sealed container. Keep chilled in the fridge. Heat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Drain the chicken portions, reserving the marinade. Place on a baking tray, presentation side down. Brush the chicken with the marinade, ensuring that all pieces are well coated. Place in the oven and cook for approx 15-20 minutes. Serve with savoury rice, a dipping bowl of peri peri sauce, lemon butter and fresh lemon wedges.

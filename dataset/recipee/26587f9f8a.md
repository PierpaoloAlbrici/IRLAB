### Ingredients

 - 8 ounce of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 2 tablespoon of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 3 tablespoon of il villaggio, mascarpone cheese, upc: 037982981300

 - 1 tablespoon of alcoholic beverage, distilled, rum, 80 proof

 - 1 tablespoon of alcoholic beverage, liqueur, coffee, 53 proof

 - 3 ounce of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

Melt the chocolate, heavy cream, and mascarpone cheese in the top of a double boiler over hot water. As the mixture starts to melt together, stir gently with a rubber spatula, being careful not to inject any excess air into the mixture. Remove mixture from the heat just before the chocolate pieces are completely melted; continue to stir until all chocolate is melted. Cool to room temperature. When the ganache is tepid, stir in the rum and coffee liqueur. Pour the mixture into a shallow, wide airtight container and refrigerate until firm. Using a vegetable peeler, shave the milk chocolate into small curls. Place in a small bowl and keep chilled. When the ganache is firm enough to shape, scoop bite-size spoonfuls and form into round balls. Coat each truffle in chocolate curls and place in mini cups (miny paper muffin liners work well). Keep chilled; bring to room temperature before serving.

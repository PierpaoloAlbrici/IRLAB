### Ingredients

 - 8 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 1/2 cup of cranberry sauce, canned, sweetened

 - 1/4 cup of marmalade, orange

 - 18 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 2 tablespoon of nuts, pecans

### Instructions

Remove cream cheese from the package and place on a plate. Mix cranberry sauce, orange marmalade and cayenne pepper. Spoon over the cream cheese. Top with pecans. Serve with pretzels or pita chips. If you dont have orange marmalade, dont be afraid to experiment! Ive used pear, papaya, and pineapple, all of which turned out great! Enjoy.

Sailor's Skillet Bread


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 12 cup of raisins, seeded


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, caraway seed


 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees; butter a heavy 9-inch skillet with an oven-proof handle. In a bowl, stir together the buttermilk, raisins, caraway seeds, and baking soda. In a separate large electric mixing bowl, beat together the butter and sugar, then stir in the buttermilk mixture. In another bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. With the mixer running on medium low, gradually add the flour mixture to the other mixed ingredients in the bowl until incorporated; do not overmix. Pour the batter into the buttered skillet and bake at 350 degrees for 60 minutes. Place a clean towel on a flat surface and carefully turn the bread out onto the towel; let stand for 30 minutes. Cut into wedges and serve warm with soft butter for spreading.

### Ingredients

 - 8 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 8 ounce of cream, sour, cultured

 - 2 teaspoon of dill weed, fresh

 - 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 1 teaspoon of onions, raw

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

### Instructions

Place Cream cheese in small sauce pan heat until melted. Add lemon juice and Dill then mix well. Allow to cool to room temperature then mix remaining ingredients and mix well. Chill for at least an hour and serve. A serving is 2 Tablespoons. If you would like to use this as a dressing you may want to add skim milk to thin and replace the cream cheese with yogurt. That's an idea I haven't tried yet. This recipe is also a great addition to Tuna salad.

Broccoli With Sesame Sauce Broccoli Goma-Ae


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of broccoli, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried


 - 12 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 12 tablespoon of miso


Instructions: 

Bring a small pot of water to a boil on the stove. Once boiling add the broccoli and boil for 3 to 5 minutes until cooked through. Transfer the broccoli to a colander and drain well. Meanwhile heat a small pan on the stove on medium high heat. Once hot, add the sesame seeds and toast for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring the seeds every so often so they brown evenly. When the seeds are golden colored and fragrant, remove from heat and transfer them to a mortar and pestle. Grind the seeds while they are still warm. Once the seeds are ground, add the sugar, soy sauce and miso and mix well. Once the broccoli has cooled, add the broccoli back to the pot and mix with the sesame dressing.

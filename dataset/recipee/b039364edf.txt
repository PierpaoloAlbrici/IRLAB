My Easy Cure to an Oncoming Cough and Cold


Ingredients


 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Pour water in a pot. Add salt. Mix well. Bring to a boil. Lower flame and simmer for a minute or until salt dissolves. Remove from flame. Pour into a glass. Now, take a small bit of this in your mouth (don't drink it) and gargle with it. Likewise, do this till you're done with the entire glass. You will feel an instant relief in your throat- the itchiness and soreness will lessen. Repeat thrice a day, everyday, till the feeling of getting the cold and cough is totally gone. This always helps me-- I hope it helps you too!

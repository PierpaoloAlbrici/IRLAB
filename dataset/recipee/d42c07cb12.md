### Ingredients

 - 34 pound of carrots, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 teaspoon of cornstarch

 - 18 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground

 - 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

 - 14 cup of orange juice, raw

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Slice each baby carrot into 2 or 3 pieces, then place in a 1 quart casserole dish with 1/4 cup water; cover and cook on high power 10 minutes or until tender. While carrots are cooking, combine sugar, cornstarch, nutmeg and ginger in a small saucepan; add orange juice. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens. Cook 1 minute, then remove from heat and stir in butter. If there is any water left in the carrots, pour it off, then pour sauce over carrots, tossing to coat evenly. Cover and let stand 4 to 5 minutes before serving.

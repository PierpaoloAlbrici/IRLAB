### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of syrup, maple, canadian

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Pour syrup in pre-heated skillet over medium flame. When bubbly, stir constantly and cook another 4 minutes. Pour into silicone baking pan (never tried anything else, so use something else at your own caution shouldn't be enough to fill entirely, you need room to work it). before completely cooled (but no longer scalding!) gently stretch out to thin and add air into it. It should be a tacky taffy/candy like consistency at this time. Pull into a long thin rod (or a couple rods - no science here). Once hardened, crack and store in a air tight container - store in a cool place. Sprinkle on things as you please!

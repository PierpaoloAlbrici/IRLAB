10 minute pizza dough!


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


Instructions: 

Mix the yoghurt and flour in a bowl to form a dough (even though it says a full cup of yoghurt I usually use just under a full cup) Transfer dough to a surface (I usually use my chopping board) and knead the dough with more self raising flour for 7 minutes adding more flour when it starts to stick Roll out and create your pizza and enjoy. You can roll it straight away but it tends to spring back because the gluten has tightened. So I tend to leave it covered for about 10-20 minutes as it makes it easier to roll out.

### Ingredients

 - 1 tablespoon of ginger root, raw

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 2 liter of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Put the ginger, sugar, yeast and lemon juice in a 2 litre soda bottle, or any other sturdy 2 litre bottle with a tight fitting cap. This is easiest done with a funnel. Add about a litre of the water and shake to dissolve all the sugar and yeast. Now fill the bottle with water, but leave about a 4 finger space at the top to allow the drink to expand. Place the bottle in a warm place, like a sunny window sill. When the bottle is completely hard you can put it in the fridge and serve it when it is cold. Open very carefully to prevent it from spraying everywhere. Strain it through a sieve into seperate glasses.

### Ingredients

 - 225 g of oats

 - 100 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 100 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

 - 825 ml of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 12 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Mix together the oatmeal, wholemeal flour, plain flour, yeast and salt in a bowl until well combined. Make a well in the centre of the mixture, then gradually add the water in a thin stream, stirring well with a wooden spoon, until the batter is well combined and the consistency of thick double cream. (NB: You may not need to use all of the water.) Cover the batter with a damp, clean tea towel and set aside for 3-4 hours (or up to 8 hours), to allow the gluten in the batter to develop. Once ready to cook the batter, whisk in the baking powder until well combined. Heat one teaspoon of the vegetable oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. When the oil is hot, add a ladleful of the batter mixture and swirl the pan to coat the bottom of it in a thin layer of the batter. Fry the oatcake for 1-2 minutes, or until golden-brown on one side. Flip the oatcake and fry for a further minute, or until golden-brown on both sides. Set the oatcake aside on a warm plate and cover with a sheet of greaseproof paper. Repeat the process with the remaining batter mixture, to make about 12 oatcakes. Stack them on top of each other, separated by greaseproof paper, and keep warm.

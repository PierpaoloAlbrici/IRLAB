Crispy Cinnamon Garbanzo Beans


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of beans, snap, green, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

1. Soak the beans overnight in cool water. Drain and pat them dry with paper towels. 2. Preheat oven to 350F. 3. In a bowl, toss the beans with the vegetable oil and sugar. 4. Spread them in a single layer on an ungreased baking sheet. Roast them in the oven until crunchy and no longer soft in the centers, about 45 minutes. (Stir them a few times to prevent burning.) 5. Immediately toss the beans in a bowl with the cinnamon and salt. Cool and serve, or store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.

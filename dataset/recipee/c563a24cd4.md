 - 2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

Heat water and sugar in a medium saucepan until sugar is dissolved. Add peanut butter to the syrup and stir until peanut butter is completely melted. Remove from heat, and stir in coconut milk. Chill for a couple hours or overnight in the refrigerator. Freeze in ice cream machine. Working fast since the ice cream is soft, layer half of the ice cream in a container. Then add the jam on top of the ice cream, spreading as best you can. Add the remaining ice cream as the final layer. Freeze 12-24 hours, or until ice cream is firm.

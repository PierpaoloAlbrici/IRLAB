Shortbread Dough


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of nuts, walnuts, english


 - 23 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 8 ounce of butter, without salt


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 325 degrees F. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper. In a food processor, grind the walnuts with 1 tablespoon sugar; transfer to a bowl. Add remaining sugar to food processor and process until superfine, about 1 minute. Add flour, salt, and ground walnuts; pulse to combine. Mix in butter and vanilla until dough is crumbly. Remove dough and form into 2 disks, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate 10 minutes. Place a dough disk on prepared cookie sheet and form into an 8 inch circle with hands. Cut into wedges, but do not separate. Bake until edges are browned, about 35 minutes, turning pan half way through cooking. Separate wedges slightly and let cool. Dough can be formed into other shapes or squares if desired.

### Ingredients

 - 2-3 cup of celery, raw

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Rinse well, all saved celery leaves and pieces. Shake as much water off as possible, and dry with paper towels. Turn oven on to 350 degrees. When at temp, turn it off. Put celery pieces and leaves on cookie sheet and put in oven. Leave in closed over about 6-8 hours. Check for dryness. You can also use a dehydrator if you have one, or just leave them out on a plate between paper towels for a few days. Take dried celery and put in grinder and grind until powder stage. Pour in bowl and add salt. I don't add as much as commercial brand celery salt. I live a stronger celery taste to mine. You can also use celery seeds and grind them up if you want. Mix celery and salt together to your taste for saltiness. I usually use about 4 parts ground celery to 2 parts salt. Sea salt makes it saltier, to me, so I cut it back to 4 parts and 1-1/2 parts sea salt.

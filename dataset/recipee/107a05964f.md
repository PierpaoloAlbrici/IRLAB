### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of honey

 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Cook honey, sugar and salt rapidly to hard-ball state - 250 degrees F. Stir occasionally. Add evaporated milk and butter. Cook rapidly to hardball stage again, stirring constantly so mixture doesn't scorch. This may take 10 to 15 minutes. Pour into well buttered 9x13 inch pan and cool completely. Once cooled, loosen caramel in pan and place on cutting board. Cut into 1-inch or smaller strips with a very sharp butchers knife. Cut strips into 1-inch squares and place in foil candy cups or wrap in squares of waxed paper. Store in an airtight container. Makes about 100 pieces of caramel.

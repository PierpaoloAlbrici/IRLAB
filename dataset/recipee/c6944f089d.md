### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of quinoa, uncooked

 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of orange juice, raw

 - 1/4 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1 cup of cranberries, dried, sweetened

 - 1/2 cup of nuts, almonds

### Instructions

Combine the quinoa, water and salt in a medium saucepan. Bring the water to a boil, and after the water begins to boil, reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. Gently simmer, covered, for 15 minutes (there may still be some water not yet absorbed). Remove from heat. Keeping the pan covered, let it stand for 5 minutes, or until the remaining water is absorbed. Remove the lid and gently fluff the quinoa. Set aside to cool. Melt butter a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in orange juice, brown sugar, cinnamon, and the dried cranberries. Bring the liquids to simmer and then gently simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Toss together the quinoa, cranberry mixture with the juices, and almonds and then serve at room temperature.

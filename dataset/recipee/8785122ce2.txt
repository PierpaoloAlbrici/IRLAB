Apricot Orange Butter


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of apricots, dried, sulfured, uncooked


 - 12 cup of orange juice, raw


 - 34 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 3 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Prepare home canning jars and lids according to manufacturer's instructions. Cook apricots and orange in water until tender. Press through a sieve or food mill. Combine apricot and orange pulp, lemon juice and sugar in a large saucepot. Cook until thick enough to round up on a spoon. As mixture thickens, stir frequently to prevent sticking. Ladle hot butter into hot jars, leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Adjust two-piece caps. Process 10 minutes in a boiling-water canner.

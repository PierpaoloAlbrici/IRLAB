### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of ice creams, vanilla

 - 2 cup of strawberries, raw

 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 4 tablespoon of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

### Instructions

Process the strawberries and sugar in a mixer or food processor. Pulse until nearly smooth, but leave a few chunks. This is best done at least a couple of hours before serving to give the strawberries a chance to absorb the sugar. Press the ice cream through a ricer into a clear glass bowl to make the "pasta". This is not easy. It takes a little time and some muscle power, but its worth it. Top the ice cream (pasta) with the strawberry sauce (spaghetti sauce). Sprinkle with coconut (the cheese topping). Serve immediately.

Ultra-Healthy Yogurt Cheese Cream


Ingredients


 - 200 g of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


 - 2 tablespoon of milk, canned, condensed, sweetened


 - 2 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Drain the yogurt overnight (at least 8 hours). The next day, it will have reduced in volume by half. Mix the condensed milk and skim milk powder in the drained yogurt, and it's done. I piped it on crackers. It really is like whipped cream. The skim milk powder makes it firm, so the cream is firm. Here I drained blueberry yogurt overnight, and just mixed in some skim milk powder. It turned into a beautiful light purple cream. The whey that drained out was sweet and purple colored, and could be enjoyed as is. No condensed milk is added for this. I needed a lot of cream to decorate a strawberry sponge cake ("strawberry shortcake") so I doubled the recipe here, and mixed it with 200 ml of whipped cream. It was delicious. It's lower in calories than 100% cream, but it was really rich. I tried it generously piped onto a strawberry mousse Bavarian cream, and it was delicious. It was great on top of simply sliced strawberries too. The color is beautiful too.

## Buttery Brussels

### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of soup, vegetable broth, ready to serve

 - 1 pound of brussels sprouts, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, salted

### Instructions

In a large saucepan, heat the broth. While the broth is heating, wash the Brussels sprouts and cut off the stems. Slice the sprouts in half. Add the sprouts (and fallen leaves) to the pan of broth. Bring the broth and Brussels to a boil and cook for 3-4 minutes. While the brussels are cooking in broth, melt the butter in a large saute pan over medium heat. Using a slotted spoon, scoop the Brussels from the broth and put them in the buttered pan (leaves too). Once in the pan, turn the sprouts flat side down and cook over medium heat until the sprouts are golden on the flat side and tender to taste (about 8-10 minutes, depending on how tender you like them). I like to use the broth with any leftovers (if there are any) for a wonderfully simple Brussels sprout soup.

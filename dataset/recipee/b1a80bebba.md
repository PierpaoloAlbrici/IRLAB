### Ingredients

 - 400 g of sweet potato, raw, unprepared

 - 100 g of sugars, brown

 - 120 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 25 to 45 ml of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Peel the sweet potatoes and cut into 1cm or so dice. Soak in plenty of water. Drain the potatoes very well, transfer to a bowl, sprinkle with light brown sugar and leave for 10 minutes. Boil water in the steamer. Cut six 9 cm squares and three 6cm squares of parchment paper. Moisture will start coming out of the sweet potatoes after 10 minutes. The moisture will be used as is. Add flour (no need to sift) and mix with a spatula. Watch the texture of the dough and add water little by little while mixing. Just add enough so that there are no lumps of flour, and the dough holds the potato pieces together. Plop the dough on the parchment paper. Put the dough and paper in the steamer and steam for 15 to 20 minutes. There's no need to cover with a kitchen towel. Test for doneness by sticking a toothpick through a piece of sweet potato; if it's cooked through the dumplings are done. Make small ones for children, or for when you're just a bit hungry. You can use less sugar to taste. If you use white castor sugar, you'll have a clean, sweet flavor. With light brown sugar the dumplings will have a mild sweetness. If you use a mixture of white castor sugar and dark brown sugar, the result will be a rich sweet flavor.

### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of mango nectar, canned

 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1/4 cup of lime juice, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of alcoholic beverage, distilled, vodka, 80 proof

### Instructions

Whisk the mango nectar, sugar, sweetened lime juice together, and vodka in a large measuring cup to dissolve the sugar. Chill in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours, until cold. Pour the mango mixture into an ice cream machine and churn until frozen and slushy, following manufacturer's directions. Freeze until solid, another 2 to 3 hours. Cook's Note: The vodka helps make the sorbet more scoopable without adding flavor.

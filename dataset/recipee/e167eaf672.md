### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of seeds, pumpkin and squash seeds, whole, roasted, without salt

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Thats it. Three simple ingredients. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Get started by laying the cleaned seeds onto a large roasting pan, spreading them out. You can let these sit overnight to dry, or you can pat them dry with some towels. Once dry, add them to a large bowl. Add in the melted butter and salt and mix really well. Add the seeds back to the roasting pan, spreading them out once again and place in the preheated oven. Roast for 30 minutes, stirring about 15 minutes in. Remove them from the oven and serve. These seeds were so addicting that they had my entire family coming back to them every few minutes. I am not kidding. They were that awesome.

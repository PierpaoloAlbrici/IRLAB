### Ingredients

 - 2 tablespoon of seeds, flaxseed

 - 6 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow

 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 34 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 cup of soymilk, original and vanilla, unfortified

 - 14 cup of oil, canola

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 425F Spray 8-inch-square baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Bring the water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add the ground flax seed, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer the ground flax seed in the water for 3 minutes or until thickened, stirring occasionally. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt until well-combined. Add the ground flax seed mixture, soy milk, and canola oil to the flour mixture. Beat just until smooth (do not overbeat.) Turn into prepared baking pan. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Cool on wire rack 10 minutes; invert cornbread onto wire rack, then turn right side up and continue to cool until warm, about 10 minutes longer.

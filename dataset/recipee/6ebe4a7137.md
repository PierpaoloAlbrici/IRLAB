### Ingredients

 - 13 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 cup of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)

 - 13 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Place a large Dutch oven (make sure you have a lid) over medium high heat on your stove top. Add oil and allow to heat for about 1 minute. Place 2-3 kernels into the pot and wait until they pop (yes, they will probably pop out of the pot). Add the remaining kernels and place lid on pot. Wait until you hear a few other kernels pop, then with oven mitts pick up pot and shake. Continue to shake for about 30 seconds every minute of cooking (place back on the burner for the remainder of the time). After the first minute, carefully lift one side of the lid and sprinkle in the sugar. Replace the lid and continue cooking and shaking (yes it is a good shoulder and bicep workout) for about 4-5 minutes, until the span of time between pops lengthens to about 5 seconds. Remove from heat. Wait until all popping has finished, then remove the lid. Sprinkle lightly with salt (to taste), then mix and place into a large serving bowl or individual serving bowls. Now close your eyes and picture the Ferris wheel. Unless it makes you sick. Then just picture something else. Nutrition info per 1 cup serving: 175 calories, 5 g fat

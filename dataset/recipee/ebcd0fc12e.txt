Milk Chocolate and Cherry Crunch


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt


 - 12 cup of cherries, sweet, raw


Instructions: 

Line an 8-inch square baking pan with foil, making sure the foil is tucked into the corners and that there is at least 1-inch overhanging the top of the pan on all sides. Melt the chocolate chips and butter, whisking occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat and stir in the cereal and cherries. Spread the chocolate mixture across the bottom of the baking pan in an even layer with a spatula (it doesn't have to be perfect). Refrigerate until hardened, about 1 hour. Break into pieces. Will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.

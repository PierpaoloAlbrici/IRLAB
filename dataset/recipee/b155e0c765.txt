Ingredients


 - 34 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 14 cup of rice vinegar, upc: 4979435030332


 - 14 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 1 teaspoon of sauce, hot chile, sriracha


 - 1 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 teaspoon of cornstarch


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground


Instructions: 

In a pot over medium-high heat mix the 1/4 cup water, rice vinegar and sugar; when mixture starts to boil, add the garlic and crushed red pepper flakes. Bring the boil down to a simmer and let it simmer for another couple of minutes (this will make sure all the flavors get infused). Add the Sriracha and ginger if using. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch and tablespoon of water until the cornstarch is dissolved. Bring the sauce to a low boil again and add the salt and cornstarch/water mixture. The sauce will begin to thicken up immediately. Cook, while stirring constantly, until the mixture reaches desired thickness, about 3-5 minutes. Let the sauce cool and then use as a dipping sauce or store in refrigerator till ready to use. **Storing does cause it to loss heat so recommend eating the same day if you like the heat**.

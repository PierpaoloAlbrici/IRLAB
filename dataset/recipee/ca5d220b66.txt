Salted Butter Caramels


Ingredients


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 1/3 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 cup of syrups, corn, light


 - 1/3 cup of honey


 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 3 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 pound of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022


Instructions: 

Line an 8-inch-square baking pan with aluminum foil that extends over the sides. With a paper towel, coat the bottom and sides of the foil with 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil. Set aside. In a 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat, bring the cream to a boil. Add the sugar, corn syrup, and honey and stir constantly with a wooden spoon or heatproof spatula until the mixture comes to a boil (about 5 minutes). Wash down the sides of the pan two times with a pastry brush dipped in warm water to prevent the sugar from crystallizing. Place a candy thermometer in the pan, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, until it registers 257F on the thermometer (about 15 minutes). Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter, vanilla paste, and 2 teaspoons of the sea salt. Pour the caramel into the prepared pan and let it sit at room temperature until cool and set (about 1 hour). With the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil, coat a cutting board and the blade of a large chefs knife. Remove the candy from the pan by by lifting out the foil; invert the caramel onto the cutting board and peel the foil off of the caramel. Cut the caramel into eight 1-inch-wide strips, then cut each strip into four pieces. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment or waxed paper. Melt and temper the chocolate (see pages 2530). Place a caramel into the tempered chocolate, coating it completely. With a dipper or fork remove the caramel from the chocolate, carefully shake off the excess chocolate, and slide the caramel off the dipper onto the paper. After dipping 4 caramels, sprinkle the center of the top of each with a pinch of sea salt. Let the caramels set up at room temperature, or chill in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. In a tightly covered container between layers of waxed paper, the caramels will keep for 1 month at room temperature.

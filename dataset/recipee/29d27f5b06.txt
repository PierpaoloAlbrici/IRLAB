Palanquetas


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2/3 cup of syrups, corn, light


 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 1/2 cup of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Line a baking sheet with a nonstick mat or grease it, and lightly grease an offset metal spatula (so that the brittle will be easier to spread). Combine the sugar, water, corn syrup, and butter in a heavy pot over medium heat and cook, stirring, until it starts to boil. Add the nuts (pumpkin seeds will pop) and continue cooking until you obtain a golden caramel color. Remove from the heat and add the baking soda and salt. Stir rapidly, being careful not to burn yourself from the steam, and then pour onto the prepared pan. Spread rapidly to your desired thickness. Let cool, and then break apart with your hands if it is thin or cut with an oiled knife into desired shapes. (If you choose to cut the brittle into shapes, do so while it is cooling but still somewhat warm. Once the brittle is completely cool it will break.) These can be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dry area. Use pieces of parchment paper between them so they dont stick to eack other. They will keep for a few weeks.

Blackberry Frozen Yogurt


Ingredients


 - 12 ounce of blackberries, raw


 - 33 ounce of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


 - 1 cup of honey


 - 1 drop of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

This recipes makes about 1 quart of frozen yogurt. Place the blackberries in the bowl of a food processor. Process until smooth. Strain the blackberries through a fine mesh sieve set over a large mixing bowl. Using the back of a spoon, press the mixture against the sieve to extract all the juice. Discard the seeds and any pulp. Add the yogurt to the blackberry juice and stir to combine. Add about 3/4 cup of honey and taste for sweetness. You may need more honey depending on how sweet the blackberries are. I used just under 1 cup. Add vanilla if desired and blend until smooth. Process in an ice cream maker according to manufacturers instructions. Serve immediately if you prefer a soft serve consistency or put it into a freezer safe container and freeze until firm. If frozen remove from the freezer about 15 minutes before serving. Recipe adapted from Southern Living Magazine.

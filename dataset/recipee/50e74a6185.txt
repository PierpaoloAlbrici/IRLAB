Golden Syrup


Ingredients


 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 12 teaspoon of vinegar, distilled


 - 1 teaspoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 13 cup of syrups, corn, light


Instructions: 

Put sugar in a small heavy pan and shake pan so the sugar is in an even layer. Sprinkle it with vinegar and water. Cook over low heat, without stirring, for 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium and cook until syrup has taken on a light caramel color, 5 to 6 minutes. Immediately remove from heat and pour in the corn syrup. DO NOT STIR, but let it bubble for 2 to 3 minutes. When the bubbling stops, stir well. Pour into sealed container. It can be stored at room temperature for several months.

Crock Pot Apple Butter


Ingredients


 - 4 pound of apples, raw, with skin


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cloves, ground


Instructions: 

During the afternoon or evening peel, core and slice the apples. The slices do not need to be thin. Stuff as many slices in the crock pot as you can, put the lid on and cook them for a few hours on the High setting. Reduce the setting to Low and let the apples cook overnight. The next morning, the apples have cooked down by about one/half and are a rich brown. Then stir in the spices to taste (about 2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoons of ground cloves) and let it cook on High for a few hours with the lid off to reduce some of the liquid. For smooth apple butter run it through the blender in small batches. Refrigerate some for immediate use and freeze the rest. Canning it in decorative jars makes a fine gift idea.

Old Fashioned Strawberry Shortcake


Ingredients


 - 1 quart of strawberries, raw


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/3 cup of shortening, vegetable, household, composite


 - 1 1/2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


Instructions: 

Mix strawberries and 1 cup sugar in a bowl and allow to stand while you complete remaining steps. Stir occasionally to help juice form. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch round baking pan. Combine flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl; cut in shortening with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir milk into crumb mixture until just blended; pour into prepared baking pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes; cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing shortcake. Split shortcake into two layers; spread bottom layer with 2 tablespoons softened butter and top with strawberries and juice. Place top layer over strawberries. Serve with whipped cream.

### Ingredients

 - 150 g of butter, without salt

 - 225 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 125 g of sugars, granulated

 - 5 drop of vanilla extract

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 180 C. Sift flour into a big bowl. Cut butter into small pieces. Using your fingers work the butter into the flour until a crumbly dough has formed. Add sugar and vanilla essence and knead well (it takes some minutes until the dough has the right consistency). Roll out the dough (it is supposed to be very thick-approx. 2-3 cm) and cut out hearts. Place on a lined baking sheet and bake for 10-15 minutes. Let cool and store in an air-tight box.

Milk Pudding


Ingredients


 - 2 tablespoon of cornstarch


 - 1/4 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 4 1/2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 3 tablespoon of honey


 - 1/3 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 1/3 cup of nuts, pistachio nuts, raw


Instructions: 

Mix the cornstarch and ground rice with about 1/2 cup cold milk and beat well, making sure that you break up any small lumps. Bring the rest of the milk to the boil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan. Add the cornstarch and ground rice mixture, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon. Keep over low heat, and stir constantly, until you feel a slight resistance. Continue to cook gently over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the cream thickens further, stirring occasionally. Be very careful not to scrape the bottom of the pan; the cream burns slightly at the bottom, and if it is scraped it will give a burnt taste to the pudding. Add the sugar toward the end. Stir in the orange blossom water and 1 tablespoon rose water, and cook a few moments more. Let the cream cool a little before pouring into a glass serving bowl. Let it cool, then chill in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap. When the pudding is cold, prepare a honey syrup in a small pan by bringing to the boil the honey with about 1/2 cup water. Stir well and add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of rose water. Let it cool and pour over the cold, firmed cream; it will seep in a little. Serve sprinkled with a pattern of chopped almonds and pistachios. Instead of garnishing with chopped nuts, serve topped with rose petal jam, which is available from Middle Eastern stores.

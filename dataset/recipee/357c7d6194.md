### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

 - 12 cup of pickles, cucumber, sour

 - 14 cup of spices, coriander seed

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, cumin seed

### Instructions

Place all ingredients in a bowl. It may be easier to warm the honey, as it is easier to blend with the other ingredients. Make sure the cucumber is drained well, otherwise your raita will be too watery. Mix well, and add to serving bowl. Sprinkle cumin over the top. Serve on top or on the side of your favorite Indian dish, or serve as a dipping sauce with naan bread.

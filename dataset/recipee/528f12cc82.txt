Sweet Pie Crust


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 6 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 6 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

In a bowl, stir together dry ingredients. Then cut in the oil and butter into the flour mixture, until crumbly. When flour/oil mixture is crumbly, add water one tablespoon at a time, blending into the flour after each tablespoonful. (You may or may not use all 6 tablespoons of water, and some people may even need more water than others.) When dough forms a ball, separate into two balls. Roll each ball out between waxed paper or plastic wrap, until the pie crust is in your desired shape. If baking this pie crust without filling, place into a pie plate, and fork the dough on the bottom of the pie plate. Bake at 475 degrees for 10-12 minutes. If you are using an unbaked pie shell to make a pie, do not fork the dough at the bottom of the pie plate, but place you filling into the pie crust and bake your pie according to your pie-filling directions.

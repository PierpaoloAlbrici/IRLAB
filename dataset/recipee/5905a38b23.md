### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of goji berries, dried

 - 3 to 4 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1/2 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 1/4 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

### Instructions

Put the bowl of your ice cream maker into the freezer 24 hours ahead (I usually keep it there all summer). Mix the mashed berries or other fruit with 3 tablespoons of the sugar, then taste critically and add more if you like. Stir in the creams and pour everything into the icy bowl of the ice cream maker. Follow the manufacturers directions for freezing.

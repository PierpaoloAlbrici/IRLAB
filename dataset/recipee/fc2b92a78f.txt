Tangy Sassy Chicken Tenderloins


Ingredients


 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1/4 cup of vinegar, cider


 - 1/4 cup of honey


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, onion powder


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 2 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw


Instructions: 

Mix all of the ingredients (except chicken) in a shallow dish then add the chicken and toss to coat. Put chicken into the refrigerator to marinate for a few hours. Pour all of the marinade and chicken into a skillet and simmer on medium until all of the marinade is caramelized and the liquid is gone. Make sure to turn over the chicken to brown both sides. This process takes about 10 -12 minutes total, depending on your stove. When the liquid is completely evaporated it is ready to serve.

### Ingredients

 - 4 pound of chicken, broilers or fryers, wing, meat and skin, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

### Instructions

Move an oven rack to the bottom rung and second rack to the top. Preheat the oven to 250F. Place the chicken wings in a large mixing bowl and sprinkle the baking powder. Mix and toss by hand to make sure the baking powder evenly coats the wings. On a baking sheet or sheets, lay down some heavy aluminum foil and spray with non-stick spray. This is important because the wing tend to stick and clean up is a pain. Place the wings on the sheet and place on the bottom oven rack and allow to bake for 30 minutes. This allows the fat in the chicken skin to render and mix with the baking powder to work it's crispy magic. Next, move the wings to the upper oven rack and raise the temperature to 425F. Bake for 40-50 minutes. Remove the wings from the oven after the are golden brown and crispy. Shake in your favorite wing sauce and serve.

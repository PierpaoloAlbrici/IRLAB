### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of oats

 - 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/4 cup of butter, without salt

 - 2 teaspoon of honey

 - 1/4 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grind oats until fine using a blender or food processor. In a medium bowl, stir together the blended oats, flour, baking soda and salt. Cut in the butter using a pastry blender or your fingers until the butter lumps are smaller than peas. Stir in the buttermilk and honey to form a stiff dough. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/8 inch in thickness. Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters. Place cookies 1 inch apart onto cookie sheets. Bake for 5 to 7 minutes in the preheated oven, until edges are lightly browned. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Using your fingertips, rub in the butter. Add just enough water to achieve a stiff, smooth dough. Shape the cakes into 2-inch-wide discs. Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat until it is very hot. Fry the cakes in the hot oil until they are brown on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes.

Asparagus With Orange Vinaigrette


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of asparagus, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of orange juice, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 1 tablespoon of orange juice, raw


Instructions: 

Wash asparagus, then trim by breaking at the point where the tough woody part of the stem meets the tender part. Steam over hot water for about 7 minutes, depending on thickness of spears; then, drain. Whisk the orange rind with oil, mustard and orange juice, and spoon over the asparagus, turning them to coat.

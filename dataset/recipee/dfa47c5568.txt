Red Bean Ice Pops Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 cup of beans, adzuki, mature seeds, raw


 - 1/2 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/8 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Place 1 cup of the beans and the cream in a large bowl and mix until evenly combined. Place the remaining 1/2 cup beans, milk, sugar, and salt in a blender and process until smooth. Pour into the bowl with the bean-cream mixture and stir to combine. (The beans will sink to the bottom.) Fill the pop molds halfway with the liquid part of the mixture. Use a spoon to evenly divide the beans left on the bottom of the bowl among the molds. Freeze until solid, at least 6 hours.

## Chaunanay's Grilled Chicken

[796220f376](http://www.food.com/recipe/chaunanays-grilled-chicken-325080)

### Ingredients

 - 2-4 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw

 - 13 cup of sauce, barbecue

 - 13 cup of salad dressing, italian dressing, commercial, regular

### Instructions

Rinse chicken and pat dry. I only use boneless skinless breasts and I cut them into strips, about 2 inches or so wide. Big enough so they won't fall through the grates on my grill! But we don't like full breasts -- hahaha. Mix equal parts Italian dressing and BBq sauce in a gallon ziploc baggie. You have to be the judge of how much marinade you need by how much chicken you are going to make. Start on the small side with the marinade, and increase to accomodate all your chicken pieces. Just use an equal amount of barbeque and Italian & you'll be good. Add chicken, and toss to coat. Marinate in fridge. Grill & enjoy! This recipe is forgiving in that if you don't have hours and hours to marinate the meat, it will still come out with a nice flavor, if you cut it into strips. If you don't it will not be as I am describing. You could also prepare in oven at 375 degrees until juices run clear, but only do that if you run out of gas on your grill:).

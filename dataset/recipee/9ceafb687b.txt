Pastry for 9-Inch Pie


Ingredients


 - 13 cup of lard


 - 1 tablespoon of shortening, vegetable, household, composite


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 18 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 3 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Mix the lard and shortening, flour, and salt with a pastry cutter until it resembles coarse grains. Add the water a teaspoon at a time until the pastry begins to clean itself from the side of the bowl. Flour a board lightly and press the ball of dough down with your hand. Lightly flour the top of the dough, then roll out with a rolling pin, always from the center out, dusting surface with flour again as necessary. Fold in half then fold again so it can easily be transferred to the pie plate. Place it in the plate and unfold. Trim edges, prick bottom of pastry all over with a fork, and cover the outer edges with tinfoil to guard against burning. Bake at 475 degrees (450 for a glass pie plate) for 8 to 10 minutes, until just lightly browned.

### Ingredients

 - 2 1/2 cup of ice creams, chocolate

 - 1 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper baking cups. Take ice cream out of freezer until it is soft but not melted. Put in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the remaining ingredients until well-blended. The mixture will be stiff. Fill each muffin cup about two-thirds full with batter. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes. Remove to a wire rack to cool completely. Let cool for about 5 minutes before serving.

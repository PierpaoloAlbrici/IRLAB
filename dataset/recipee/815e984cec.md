### Ingredients

 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 tablespoon of honey

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of oats

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

### Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and stir until it dissolves. Add the honey (or agave nectar, if you prefer a vegan version), stir, and set aside for a few minutes. 2. Meanwhile, mix flour, oats, and salt in a large bowl. Mix the wet mixture into the dry and stir until completely combined. 3. Brush a loaf pan generously with the melted butter (or Earth Balance margarine) before transferring the dough into the pan. Cover with a slightly damp towel and set in a warm place for 30 minutes. 4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F with a rack in the middle. Once the bread has risen, bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until golden and pulling away from the sides. 5. Turn on the broiler for 20-30 seconds and watch closely, removing the bread once the top reaches a slightly darker cooler. Turn the bread out of the pan almost immediately, allowing to cool on a wire rack. Serve warm with butter.

Asian Slaw With Tofu Croutons Lorna Sass Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of cabbage, raw


 - 1 cup of peppers, sweet, green, raw


 - 1/2 cup of onions, spring or scallions (includes tops and bulb), raw


 - 4 ounce of tofu, raw, regular, prepared with calcium sulfate


 - 2/3 cup of miso


Instructions: 

1. In a large serving bowl or possibly storage container, combine the cabbage, bell pepper, scallions, and tofu. Toss in sufficient dressing to coat the slaw thoroughly. Serves 4 to 6. NOTE: "Napa cabbage is the ideal choice for this simple slaw, but it's a bit delicate. For optimum taste and texture, spin the rinsed leaves dry before shredding them, and toss in the dressing just before serving. A practical solution is to dress just the amount you'll be needing. For a sturdier slaw which can be refrigerated for a few days, use green head cabbage, or possibly a mix of green and red cabbages, instead of napa." Soymilk Lorna J.

The fact which these dishes have health benefits make them which much more appealing. So if you would like to eat healthier food, and need some ideas on how to do which - here's the book for you.

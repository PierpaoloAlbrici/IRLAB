Instructions: 

melt butter and mix with milk. make sure the mixture is 30 C, then dissolve yeast in mixture. You can use dry yeast instead, but then you want to mix it with the dry ingredients and increase the temperature of the milk by a couple of degrees. However, they do turn out best with fresh yeast. If you're using dry yeast 25 g should be enough mix all dry ingredients well add milk mixture to dry mixture and knead for 3-4 mins. if you're using a machine, mix for 8 minutes lightly grease a large bowl an place the dough in it. leave to rise for 30 mins When risen knead a couple of times only. roll the dough into a rectangle. Size depends on how chunky you want the buns. I usually roll it out till it's 5-8 mm thick. you'll want to handle your dough gently from now as it is rising. smooth on a thin layer of margarine, sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon in even layers on top. I generally use more sugar than I think I need as some of it will melt away in the oven. Don't really measure out this part roll into a sausage. make sure it's pretty tightly rolled. cut 1 inch slices. I use my index finger to measure, so about the length of the two first joints ;) place on baking sheets with the sliced side up. I normally place 12 on each sheet to give them enough room to rise. leave to rise under kitchen towels in a warm room for an hour. Heat your oven to 210 C Brush a bit of milk on the buns and bake for 10-15 minutes cool on a wire rack The icing is one I borrowed from a Cinnabon recipe

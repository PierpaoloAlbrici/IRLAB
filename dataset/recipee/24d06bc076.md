### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 1/2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

Mix together flour, soda, salt, and sugar. Add sour milk and stir together with a wooden spoon. The dough should be thick and sticky, but not too wet. Turn dough onto a floured surface and form with hands into a round loaf. Place the loaf into a cast-iron frying pan or heavy round casserole dish that has been greased with butter. Score the top in the form of a cross with a wet knife (dig in at least an inch). Bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes. Bread should cool for an hour before serving (but I like to eat it while it's still warm! ). Note: If the loaf is made with whole-meal wheat flour, it is known as brown bread; if made with unbleached white flour, it's Irish soda bread. Authentic Irish soda bread is made with sour milk, not buttermilk, or milk soured by adding vinegar or lemon juice. To sour milk, simply leave it out overnight.

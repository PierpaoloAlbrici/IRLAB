Buttermilk Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 2 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 375F. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar. Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add the buttermilk; stir just until the mixture comes together; the batter will be sticky. Transfer to a lightly floured work surface; use your floured fingers to pat the dough to 1-inch thickness. Use a 2 1/2-inch round biscuit cutter or cookie cutter to cut out the biscuits, as close together as possible to minimize scraps. Transfer to a baking sheet; bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until lightly browned. Remove from the oven; cool on a wire rack. Serve warm. Add 3 cups (9 ounces) grated Cheddar cheese to the butter and flour mixture after the butter has been cut in. Proceed with the remainder of the recipe.

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 34 cup of blueberries, raw

 - 1 1/4 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

### Instructions

In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking power, and salt. Cut butter into dry ingredients. Stir in fruit (if desired). Add whipping cream and stir by hand just until dough forms. Dough will be soft and sticky. Cover and refrigerate 2 hours. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently until dough just holds together. Press dough into a 10-inch circle, 1-inch thick. Cut into wedges. Place scones on baking sheet and sprinkle scones with remaining sugar. Bake 15-20 minutes at 400 degrees or until scones are a light golden brown on top.

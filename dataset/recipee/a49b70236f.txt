Bailey's Cheese Wafers Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 1/4 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350F degrees. In a large bowl, cream the cheeses and butter. Stir in salt and white pepper. Mix flour in thoroughly till you can make a ball. Divide dough in half, then keep dividing in half till you have 32 small balls, rolling them with your hands. Place the balls about 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet and flatten slightly. Bake for 15 min, or possibly till golden brown. Remove with a spatula to a cooling rack. Notes: Lee's Intro: I like the flavor of cheese with sorrel soup. Cheese is strong sufficient to hold its own with the sorrel.

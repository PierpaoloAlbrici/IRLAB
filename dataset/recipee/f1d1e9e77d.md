### Ingredients

 - 2 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 pound of butter, without salt

 - 2 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 16 ounce of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 1/3 cup of nuts, almonds

### Instructions

Using a heavy cooking pot, add the sugar and water, and without stirring, bring the mixture to a temperature of 230*. On an electric stove the burner is kept on high the entire time. (When I make it on a gas stove I also keep the burner on high flame. ). When the temperature reaches 230* add the butter, 1 stick at a time, stirring constantly in a figure 8 until each is melted. Add 2 cups of whole raw almonds and continue cooking until the mixture is a caramel color. Pour onto a buttered cookie sheet (NO NOT scrape the pot!) and immediately set on packed snow, or float in ice water to cool. (If there was no snow, Susan added water and lots of ice to the bathtub. ). Melt the 2 chocolate bars in a microwave. Grind the 1 1/3 cup raw almonds fine or put them in a blender. After the candy has cooled, spread with the chocolate, and dust heavily with the ground almonds. Turn over and repeat on the other side. Let stand for a few hours to 'set'. Break into pieces and ENJOY! I have no idea how many servings this would be called -- .

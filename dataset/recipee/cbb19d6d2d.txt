 - 1 teaspoon of oil, sesame, salad or cooking


 - 1/2 pound of beans, snap, green, raw

 - 13 cup of oil, corn, peanut, and olive


 - 2 dash of salt, table


Instructions: 

Start a large pot of water on the stove to boil. Have a large bowl full of ice water on hand at the ready to stop the beans from cooking once blanched. While the water is coming to a boil, add your miso paste to a small mixing bowl. Drizzle in the rice wine vinegar and sesame oil and whisk it until the miso paste has incorporated into the other ingredients and the dressing is smooth. Taste dressing for salt level and adjust to your liking. When your water has come to a boil, drop the trimmed wax beans into the water. Blanch for 1-2 minutes. With a slotted spoon or tongs, pull them out and drop them into the ice bath; this will stop them from cooking further and getting soggy. Leave them in the ice bath for a minute or so then drain the beans thoroughly. On a serving platter, arrange the wax beans in an even layer. Drizzle the dressing over the beans. Top with a sprinkle of chopped cilantro and chopped peanuts. Grind a touch of fresh black pepper over the plate. Serve immediatelythe beans will get too soggy if you wait to serve them once theyre dressed.

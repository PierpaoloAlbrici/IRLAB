Anna's Uncooked Fudge Slice


Ingredients


 - 125 g of butter, without salt


 - 200 g of milk, canned, condensed, sweetened


 - 250 g of martha white foods, martha white's buttermilk biscuit mix, dry


 - 1 tablespoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


 - 34 cup of raisins, seeded


 - 12 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


 - 2 cup of sugars, powdered


 - 2 tablespoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


 - 75-100 g of butter, without salt


 - 2-4 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Melt butter over a low heat, add condensed milk. Crush wine biscuits by putting them inside a plastic kitchen bag and rolling them with a rolling pin until resembling large breadcrumbs. Pour butter mixture over biscuits, and mix in cocoa, sultanas and coconut. Press into a slice tin then ice. To make chocolate icing, mix icing sugar, second measure of cocoa powder, second measure of butter and water together - butter and water amounts vary according to personal taste. Too much water and the icing won't set well. Slice when cool, and store in fridge. Also freezes well.

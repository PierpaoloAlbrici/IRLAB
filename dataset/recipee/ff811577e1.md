### Ingredients

 - 100 g of nuts, pistachio nuts, raw

 - 100 g of nuts, almonds

 - 3 tablespoon of oil, corn, peanut, and olive

### Instructions

Grind the nuts without the oil in a food processor for five minutes or until the nuts form a smooth paste. Add the oil to taste, I like mine to be quite spreadable so add three tablespoons - you might want to play with yours to get it as you like it. Sterilise the jar and lid by boiling for fifteen minutes. Pour the butter into the jar and keep refrigerated.

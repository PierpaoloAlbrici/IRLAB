How to Cook Delicious Rice in a Saucepan


Ingredients


 - 150 g of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 200 ml of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Rinse rice with water and drain well. Put rice in the saucepan and pour the listed amount of water. Soak for at least 30 minutes (I usually leave it for more than an hour). Cook the rice. Cover with a lid and cook over high heat until boiling (you can lift the lid to check the progress). Once it's boiling, turn down to low heat and cook for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, turn up to high heat again for 5 seconds or so and turn off. Let it steam for 10 minutes with the lid on. Then, open the lid and gently stir the rice from the bottom. FYI... 1.5 rice cooker cups is 225 g of raw rice + 300 ml of water. 2 rice cooker cups is 300 g of raw rice + 400 ml of water. Cooking 1.5 rice cooker cups is a very useful amount. I cooked 2 rice cooker cups' worth of raw rice in a Le Creuset pot. It was fluffier and sweeter than what you'd get with with a normal saucepan.

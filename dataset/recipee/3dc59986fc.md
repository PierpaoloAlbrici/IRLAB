### Ingredients

 - 5 1/2 ounce of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 1/2 ounce of cheese, cheddar

 - 10 ounce of martha white foods, martha white's buttermilk biscuit mix, dry

 - 4 ounce of butter, without salt

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1 teaspoon of parsley, fresh

### Instructions

Mix ingredients in the order shown. (For biscuits). Do not over mix, which causes biscuits to be tough. Drop biscuits onto a nonstick cookie sheet. Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Prepare garlic bread topping by mixing ingredients together. After cooking biscuits dab each one with the topping using a pastry brush and serve.

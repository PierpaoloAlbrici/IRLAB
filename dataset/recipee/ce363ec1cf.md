[ce363ec1cf](http://www.food.com/recipe/quickest-easiest-and-healthiest-pie-crust-ever-invented-330427)

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 cup of oil, corn, peanut, and olive

 - 1/3-1/2 cup of apple juice, canned or bottled, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Mix flour and salt in a medium bowl. Stir in the oil using a fork and mix well. Add apple juice (use the greater amount for a softer crust) and mix well. It will seem very wet at first but will dry out right away. Form a ball in your hand and slice in half. Roll out each half, one at a time, between 2 sheets of wax paper. Use these as your top and bottom crust.

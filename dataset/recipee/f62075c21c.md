### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of arugula, raw

 - 4 tablespoon of parsley, fresh

 - 3 ounce of nuts, walnuts, english

 - 2 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 2 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 6 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

To measure, push the roughly chopped arugula into your measuring cup -- not too hard, but don't measure loosely. Put this in your processor. Add the rest of the ingredients, and whizz. I prefer a pesto which is not too smooth, but slightly "granular" still. NOTES: If you're using ready-washed arugula and parsley which are dry, you might want to add a tiny bit more oil. Mine usually has water on the leaves, which adds to the liquid available. You can toast the walnuts lightly. I prefer walnuts because they contain more oil than other nuts. The arugula should definitely be young -- the moment they start going to seed the leaves become very bitter. The pesto should stand, covered, in the fridge for a few hours or more, as the flavours then meld better. Delicious forked into hot al dente spaghetti, with extra, fresh parmesan shavings on top. Can be dropped into a mixed greens salad by teaspoonsful. I eat this on hot toast as well. (Ah well, takes all kinds to make a world -- ! ).

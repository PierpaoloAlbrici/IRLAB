### Ingredients

 - 100 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 100 g of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

Put the dry ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Stir in the milk until thickened, then pour it into moulds. Put water in a pot (to a height of the first joint of your finger). Place the steamer in the pot, and steam for 10 minutes on medium to high heat for a fluffy finish. They're done when a skewer poked through the middle comes out clean.

[158a0878c2](http://www.food.com/recipe/p-b-j-energy-squares-213755)

### Ingredients

 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

 - 1 1/2 cup of oats

 - 1 cup of grapes, red or green (european type, such as thompson seedless), raw

 - 14 cup of wheat germ, crude

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees and grease a 9" x 13" pan. Mix flour, baking soda and salt; set aside. In a large bowl, beat butter and brown sugar at high speed until creamy. Beat in peanut butter until blended. Reduce speed to low; blend in flour mixture and oats. Spread 2/3 of the batter in the pan with a spatula. Spread grape jam/jelly carefully over the batter. Sprinkle with wheat germ, if used. Spoon out small dollops of remaining batter and scatter over the jam/jelly. Bake 25 minutes, until golden (the squares will be bubbly and still look soft).

Milk and Honey Cold Remedy


Ingredients


 - 8 ounce of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of honey


Instructions: 

Microwave the milk in a mug until piping hot, or about 1 minute 30 seconds. Stir in the honey completely, so that no honey is left sitting on the bottom and the milk turns a golden color. I use the measuring spoon to stir the honey in the milk. Drink hot.

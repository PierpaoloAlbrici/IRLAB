### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 2 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 2-3 drop of beets, raw

### Instructions

Use an electric mixer or electric beater to whip the jam and vanilla smooth. Stir in the cream and, if desired, a few drops of red food coloring or beet juice. Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and whip until the cream is stiff. When it has the light, airy consistency of whip cream, continue whipping it for one minute longer to give it a firmer texture. Use immediately.

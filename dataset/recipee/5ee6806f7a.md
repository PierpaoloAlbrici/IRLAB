 - 2 cup of oats

### Instructions

Combine soy milk and oats in a blender. Blend on high speed for 1 minute until smooth and creamy. Transfer to medium bowl and refrigerate for 2 hours (You can do this the night before too- that's what I do) until thick and batter like. Stir in nuts, maple syrup, maple sugar and cinnamon until well combined and set aside. Lightly grease and preheat waffle iron on a moderate to low setting until hot (it should not be smoking). Spoon the batter about 2/3 cup per waffle into prepared iron Cook on low setting until steaming stops about 4-5 minutes.

Crunchy Granola


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of oats


 - 12 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 12 cup of wheat germ, crude


 - 14 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 14 cup of oat bran, raw


 - 3-4 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 12 cup of apple juice, canned or bottled, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid


 - 3-4 tablespoon of honey


 - 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 300; butter or oil a baking sheet. In a bowl, mix the first 10 ingredients together. In a small bowl, whisk the apple juice, honey, vanilla, and butter together. Pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients; toss well to mix. Spread granola on the baking sheet; bake for approximately 45 minutes, stirring the granola well every 15 minutes, until it is a shade browner than it started and dry to the touch (it will become crisper as it cools). Cool on the baking sheet, break up any large pieces; store in an airtight container.

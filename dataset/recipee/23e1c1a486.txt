Ingredients


 - 1 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 1 cup of dates, deglet noor


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of chocolate, dark, 70-85% cacao solids


Instructions: 

Place the almonds in a food processor or mini chopper and pulse until it resembles coarse meal. Add the dates, almond butter, vanilla and salt. Pulse for a couple minutes until it forms a dough. Stir in cacao nibs, if using. You can use your hands to knead in the cacao nibs as the dough is thick. Shape about 1 tablespoon of dough into a round cookie shape and place on parchment paper. Enjoy right away or place the cookies into the fridge for storage.

Cajun Pot RoastThis is an Extremely Versatile and Delicious Recipe.


Ingredients


 - 4 pound of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw


 - 2 1/4 cup of salad dressing, italian dressing, commercial, regular


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Combine the roast and 2 cups of the salad dressing in a large plastic storage bag. Squeeze out excess air, seal tightly, and massage to coat the meat all over. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to overnight, turning the roast over at least once. Preheat a heavy (preferably cast-iron) Dutch oven over high heat. Add the oil. Remove the roast from the marinade, and add it to the pan. Brown on all sides, 4 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle the meat with the seasoned salt and pepper. Add the water and the remaining 1/4 cup salad dressing. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook until very tender, about 3 hours, checking occasionally to see if additional water is needed.

### Ingredients

 - 1 1/3 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 3 cup of oats

 - 1 cup of oat bran, raw

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 14 cup of honey

 - 2 tablespoon of molasses

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 14 cup of syrup, maple, canadian

 - 1 1/2 cup of raisins, seeded

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F. In a large bowl, toss the almonds, oats, bran, and cinnamon. In a small saucepan, combine the honey, molasses, oil, and syrup over medium heat. Warm and stir until the mixture begins to foam, then QUICKLY remove from heat. Pour mixture over the nuts and grains and mix thoroughly. Pour the granola into a large, rimmed baking sheet in an even layer. Bake for 40 minutes, stirring every 10, until everything is nice and toasted. Allow the mixture to cool before adding in the raisins. Once throroughly cooled, this granola can be stored in an airtight container for up to a month-- but it will probably disappear long before then!

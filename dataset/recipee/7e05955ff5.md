### Ingredients

 - 2 quart of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 quart of blueberries, raw

### Instructions

In medium to large pot, pour water over blueberries. Simmer mixture until desired shade is reached. Strain berries from mixture and cool to room temperature. Add wool. Place over low heat and gradually increase temperature of mixture until it is just simmering. Simmer until desired shade is reached. Immerse wool into a pot of plain water that is nearly as hot as the dye bath. Rinse again in another pot of plain water that is a bit cooler than the last pot. Continue immersing the wool in gradually cooler pots of water until the water is clear after the wool is immersed in it and the wool is slightly warm. Remove excess water by gently pushing the wool with your hands and then blot dry with a clean towel. NOTE: This book has several dye recipes for use with or without mordants.

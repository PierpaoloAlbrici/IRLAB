Machine Shed Creamy Coleslaw


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of carrots, raw


 - 1 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular


 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 12 teaspoon of celery, raw


Instructions: 

Place cabbage in a very large bowl and set aside. In medium bowl, stir together mayo, sugar and celery seeds. Add to cabbage mixture and toss to coat. Cover and chill at least 4 hours. Tip: I use both bags of coleslaw, total 32oz. I just add a little more mayo, sugar and seeds. I also make mine the night before, and mix it every so often to blend.

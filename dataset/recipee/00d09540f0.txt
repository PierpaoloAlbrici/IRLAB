Vienna Sugar Cookies


Ingredients


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Dissolve yeast in warm water and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, beat butter until creamy. Gradually add flour. Add yeast mixture and blend well. Refrigerate dough until well chilled. Spread sugar out on a large piece of waxed paper. Roll walnut-sized balls of dough into the sugar, pressing flat until dough is thin, about the size of a doughnut. Keep flipping dough and pressing into sugar during this stage. Place on ungreased baking sheets. Bake at 375 degrees for 10-15 minutes, until very lightly browned around the edges. Cool on racks.

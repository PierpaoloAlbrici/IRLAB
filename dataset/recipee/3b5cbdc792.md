### Ingredients

 - 3 1/4 pound of squash, winter, butternut, raw

 - 14 cup of marmalade, orange

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 450 deg. Line a large shallow baking pan with nonstick foil. (I lightly sprayed regular foil with cooking spray). Cut the squash into 3/4 inch thick slices and then into 1 1/2 inch wedges. Place in a large bowl. Combine the marmalade, butter and ginger in a microwave safe dish. Microwave on high for 1 minute and stir until all melted together. Toss with the squash and place in the baking pan in a single layer. Roast 25 to 30 minutes or until the squash is tender and glazed. Serve warm or at room temperature. You can cut up the squash a day ahead, and store in a large plastic bag. You can also make the marmalade glaze a day ahead and refrigerate - warm up in the microwave and proceed with step 4.

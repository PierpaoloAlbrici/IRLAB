 - 13 cup of bacon, meatless


 - 2 tablespoon of onions, raw


 - 14 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3 cup of tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

Instructions: 

Saute 2 tablespoons minced fresh onions in 1/3 cup bacon fat in an iron skillet. Stir in 1/4 cup flour and brown lightly. Add 1/4 cup flour and saute until lightly browned. Mash enough fresh tomatoes with a potato masher to yield 3 cups. Add mashed tomatoes, black pepper and salt to saute mixture. Cook until flour has thickened tomatoes. Add 1 tablespoon sugar. Cook just long enough to dissolve sugar. Stir in cubed toast just until combined. Serve.

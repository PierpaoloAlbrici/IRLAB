Salted Caramel Sauce


Ingredients


 - 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 3/4 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the water and sugar. Over medium-low heat, slowly bring to a boil, stirring occasionally until sugar is fully dissolved. Once mixture is boiling, let it boil for about 10-15 minutes or until mixture turns a dark brown color. Remove mixture from heat and stir in a few spoons full of cream. The cream will harden as you stir, which is normal. Continue to add the rest of cream and stir until combined. Stir in butter, vanilla extract and sea salt. Pour caramel sauce into a mason jar or other glass container to cool completely. Enjoy! Notes: 1. Sauce will keep refrigerated for up to three weeks. 2. Recipe makes about 1 1/2 cups of sauce.

Macadamia Brittle


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 cup of nuts, macadamia nuts, raw


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/3 cup of honey


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 350. Spread the nuts on a 13-by-10-inch rimmed baking sheet and bake for 5 minutes, or until lightly toasted. Transfer the nuts to a plate; let cool and coarsely chop. Wipe off the baking sheet and oil it lightly. In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, honey and butter, and boil over moderately high heat until a candy thermometer inserted in the syrup registers 290, about 7 minutes. Stir in the chopped nuts and scrape the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet; spread in an even layer. Let cool completely, then break into large pieces.

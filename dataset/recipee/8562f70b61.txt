Drizzle


Ingredients


 - 1 gallon of apples, raw, with skin


 - 1 teaspoon of vinegar, balsamic


Instructions: 

put one gallon of apple cider in crock pot if you don't have time to babysit --. if using a crock pot you may end up having to leave the lid slightly askew so moisture can escape. If on the stove bring to a boil then turn down right away to a simmer. You want to reduce this down to about 1/3. The best way to describe the right consistency is thinner than maple syrup, but if put into the frig it will become loosely gelatinous. Once the cider has reduced to your liking start adding the balsamic vinegar, I just use a splash, you may like more or less, or you may wish to leave it out all together. If I'm canning this I strain mine through a jelly bag as I prefer it clear, but if I'm using it straight away I don't bother with this step. pour into sterile jars and boil water bath for ten minutes. prep and cooking times are estimates since it depends on your method.

Herbfarm Rosemary Shortbread


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 cup of butter, without salt


 - 23 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, rosemary, dried


 - 2 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 cup of rice flour, white, unenriched


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F; line two baking sheets with parchment paper. With an electric mixer (although you could do it by hand, if you like), cream the butter until it is a pale yellow and is light in texture. With the mixer running on medium low, gradually add the sugar and mix until it is fluffy. Add the rosemary and mix until well incorporated, then add the flours and salt and mix until thoroughly combined; the dough will be soft. Place dough in a container (or wrap in plastic) and chill for at least 1 hour. Generously flour a board, flour the rolling pin, and gently roll the chilled dough (try not to work it too much or roll it too thin) to form a rectangle about 10x14-inches and about 1/4-inch thick. Cut the cookies into 1 1/2-inch by 2-inch rectangles (or whatever shape you'd like - I find it easier to use a round cookie/biscuit cutter; when doing multiple batches make sure to put the unused dough in the freezer to keep it chilled in between the times you're rolling it out). Place the cut cookies about 1/2-inch apart on the parchment-covered baking sheets and sprinkle with sugar (if using - I don't, they don't need it in my opinion). Bake in the center of the preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until they are golden brown on the edges. Remove from oven and transfer cookies to wire racks to cool. Store cooled cookies in airtight containers - their flavor will improve as they age, so if you can make them at least two days in advance that's the best to do; they'll keep for a week. Note: I know that the amount of fresh rosemary sounds like a lot, but really, it *isn't* - don't decrease it. :).

Cleaned-Up Scottish Oatcakes


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of oats


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


 - 2-3 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Heat oven to 375. Mix the dry ingredients, then cut the shortening in until it resembles fine crumbs. (I gave up on this and just smooshed it with my hands.) Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until mixture forms a stiff dough when you press it together. (Alternatively, you can mix this in your food processor). On lightly wheat-floured surface, roll the dough out to about 1/8-inch thick. If needed, use ice water as "glue" to patch it together- It might fall apart a little. Cut into rounds with a large cookie cutter or the top of a glass about 2 1/2" in diameter. Or you can cut it into squares with a knife. Place on and ungreased baking sheet. Bake until the oatcakes start to brown, about 12-15 minutes. Cool a bit on a wire rack, if your gang will wait that long. To serve, top with whatever you find in your kitchen. These are not sweet, so they make a great base for sweeter toppings like jelly and honey. Other toppings we've use are peanut butter, butter, sliced fruit, cream cheese and coconut. I think we even used chocolate chips a time or two. Use your imagination! Per serving (2 oatcakes): 183 calories, 3g protein, 16g carbohydrate, 12g healthy fats, 2.5g fiber, 135mg sodium.

Korean Pancakes


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/4 teaspoon of oil, sesame, salad or cooking


 - 1/2 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Put the flour in a mixing bowl, and add the salt, sesame oil and 1/2 teaspoon peanut oil. Blend with a wire whisk while adding the water. Line another mixing bowl with a sieve and pour the batter into the sieve, pushing any solids through with a rubber or plastic spatula. Rub a Teflon skillet with oil, and heat. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the batter into the hot skillet, and spread it out quickly and gently with the back of a spoon to make a round, thin, almost transparent pancake. Add a second and third batch, rounding out each. Let each pancake cook about 20 seconds on one side without browning, turn, and cook the second side about 1 minute without browning. As the pancakes are cooked, transfer them to a plate. Rub the skillet between batches with a small amount of oil. Continue until all the batter is used.

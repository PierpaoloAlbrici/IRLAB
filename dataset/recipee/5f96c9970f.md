### Ingredients

 - 13 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 tablespoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 4 teaspoon of cornstarch

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 2 tablespoon of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

### Instructions

Mix sugar, cocoa, cornstarch and salt in heavy bottom saucepan. Gradually add 1/2 of the milk, whisking until smooth. Add remaining mix, whisking to combine. Over medium heat, continue whisking until pudding thickens and comes to a boil, about 5 minutes. Allow to boil 1 minute longer and then remove from heat. Add chocolate chips and vanilla extract and whisk until chocolate melts and pudding is smooth. Divide between 2 dessert dishes, cover with plastic wrap touching the surface of the pudding so that it doesn't form a skin (yuck!). Cool completely- overnight is best. Serve with whipped cream.

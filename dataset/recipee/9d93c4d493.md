### Ingredients

 - 7 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 teaspoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow

### Instructions

1. Spray the inside of a slow cooker well with cooking spray. Turn the heat to high. 2. Add the ingredients and stir well. Cover and leave on high for 1 hour, then lift the lid, stir well, and turn the heat to low. 3. Continue cooking, stirring very occasionally (once an hour or so), until tender or very thick, 6 to 9 hours. Serve hot, as is, or chill and set up for later use. 4. We added shredded cheese when we were done and it came out really good! Add pepper to your taste!

Cream Cheese with Honey and Candied Pecans


Ingredients


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 3 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 8 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 1/2 cup of honey


Instructions: 

Melt butter in a skillet and brown slightly over medium heat. Add pecans and brown sugar and stir to coat the pecans with butter and sugar. Let cook about 3-5 minutes until sugar has melted and sauce is bubbly. Transfer pecans and sauce from pan onto a plate lined with parchment paper and set aside to let sugar harden around the pecans. In a bowl, add cream cheese and honey and whip with a hand mixer. Add pecans (you might have to break them up a bit) and mix just for about 10-15 seconds to break up the pecans a bit more and get them incorporated into the cream cheese mixture. Spread on your favorite breads, bagels, French toast ... whatever! Enjoy!

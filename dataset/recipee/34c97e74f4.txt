Oven Ribs


Ingredients


 - 4 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 3 tablespoon of vinegar, red wine


 - 3 tablespoon of tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 teaspoon of cornstarch


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, paprika


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, onion powder


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 1 teaspoon of oil, canola


 - 1 pound of pork, fresh, loin, country-style ribs, separable lean only, raw


Instructions: 

Mix the non-rib ingredients together in a bowl, whisking to combine. Make an aluminum foil packet around the ribs and seal it except for one end. Pour the sauce ingredients from the bowl into the aluminum foil packet and seal it, tightly. Slosh the contents around being careful not to puncture the foil. When the sauce feels like it has been distributed fully over the ribs, place in a heated 225 degree (Fahrenheit) oven for 5 hours. Remove the foil packet from the oven and carefully pour the juices into a skillet. Set the meat into a bowl and extract the bones. Over a medium-high heat, reduce the juices into a sauce, pour over the meat, and serve, hot.

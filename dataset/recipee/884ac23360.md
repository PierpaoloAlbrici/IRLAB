### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of nuts, cashew nuts, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, rosemary, dried

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, thyme, dried

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 2 teaspoon of sugars, brown

 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350. Spread out the nuts on a baking sheet and toast until golden brown, about 10 minutes. In a large bowl, combine the remaining ingredients. With a big wooden spoon, stir the nuts in the herb mixture, making sure the butter melts and moving the nuts around so they are evenly coated. Transfer to a pretty bowl and let sit for 5 minutes to crisp the nuts before serving.

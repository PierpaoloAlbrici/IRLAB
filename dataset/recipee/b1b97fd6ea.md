### Ingredients

 - 14 ounce of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, poppy seed

 - 2 tablespoon of onions, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 2 tablespoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 14 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Tear pita pockets in half so you have 2 half circles. Cut each half circles into smaller triangles. (about 8 triangles each). Spray (or brush) a cooking sheet with olive oil. Place Pita triangles with the rough side up. Spray (or brush) each triangle with olive oil. Sprinkle the remaining ingredients on top of the the pita triangles. You can adjust measurements according to your taste. Bake at 350 for 5-7 minutes or until the bottom of the chips are browned. I like mine a little toastier so I turned the broiler on for a couple minutes and toasted the top side too.

Instructions: 

In a bowl, combine the shrimp, olive oil, 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice, garlic, Essence, and pepper flakes and toss to coat the shrimp evenly. Let marinate, refrigerated, for at least 1 and up to 2 hours. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, place the potatoes and enough salted water to cover by 1-inch and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are just tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and place in a large bowl. Toss with 1 tablespoon of the extra-virgin olive oil, 1 teaspoon of the remaining lemon juice, and a pinch of the salt. Set aside. Preheat the grill to high heat. Remove the shrimp from the marinade and grill the shrimp, turning, until opaque, pink, and cooked through, about 3 minutes. Remove from the grill and set on a platter to cool slightly. Add the shrimp to the bowl with the potatoes. Add the remaining extra-virgin olive oil, the remaining 2 teaspoons lemon juice, the olives, capers, cilantro, salt, and pepper and toss to combine. Adjust the seasoning, to taste, and serve on small plates, garnishing each plate with a sprig of cilantro. Combine all ingredients thoroughly.

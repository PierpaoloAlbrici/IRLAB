Cream Cheese Frosting


Ingredients


 - 4 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 12 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Place the cream cheese and butter in a medium-sized bowl, and cream them with a fork or a hand-held electric mixer on medium speed until smooth, about 45 seconds. Sift the confectioners' sugar over the cream cheese mixture, then beat, using a hand-held electric mixer on medium speed, until the frosting is creamy. Stir in vanilla. Use immediately, or cover the refrigerate. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour before serving.

### Ingredients

 - 2 1/2 pound of potatoes, raw, skin

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, paprika

 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Slice potatoes into French fries, and place into cold water so they won't turn brown while you prepare the oil. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. While the oil is heating, sift the flour and spices into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water so that the mixture can be drizzled from a spoon. Dip potato slices into the batter one at a time, and place in the hot oil so they are not touching at first. The fries must be placed into the skillet one at a time, or they will clump together. Fry until golden brown and crispy. Remove and drain on paper towels.

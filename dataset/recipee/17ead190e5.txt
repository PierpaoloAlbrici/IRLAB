Oatmeal Cookie Granola


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of oats


 - 13 cup of seeds, flaxseed


 - 12 cup of sugars, brown


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 18 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground


 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 13 cup of honey


 - 4 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Combine oats, flax, brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large bowl. In a small saucepan, melt butter and add honey. Once it starts to simmer, remove from heat and quickly stir in extract. Mix well, and pour over dry mixture. Mix to coat thoroughly, and place on a greased cookie sheet. Place into the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, until done. Allow to cool completely, break into large pieces and store in an airtight container. *Note - granola nuggets form better if you stir the granola as little as possible while baking, and don't stir it at all while it's cooling.

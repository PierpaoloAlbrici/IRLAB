### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of peaches, yellow, raw

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1 cup of blueberries, raw

 - 34 cup of oats

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F. Peel and core apples, if using. Cut peaches or apples into 1/2-inch wedges and place in a bowl. Sprinkle with cinnamon and toss until evenly coated. If using peaches, mix in berries. (Blueberries will turn the apples gray.) Press down firmly in a 9-inch pie plate. In a medium-sized bowl, stir flour with rolled oats and brown sugar.Slowly add butter, working in with a fork. Carefully mound on top of fruit and gently press into surface. Bake in centre of preheated oven for 60-70 minutes or until fruit is tender when pierced with a skewer. This crisp is wonderful served warm with ice cream or yoghurt cheese

Devonshire Splits


Ingredients


 - 1/2 pound of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 ounce of butter, without salt


 - 1/4 pint of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Using a food-processor, a food mixer with a dough hook, or your hands, mix the dry ingredients, add the warm milk and melted butter and mix and knead to a smooth elastic dough. Cover with lightly oiled polythene and leave to rise until doubled in size - about 1 hour in a warm place. Knock back and knead again briefly. Divide the dough into eight and shape into small round buns. Space them well apart on a greased baking tray. Cover and set aside to prove (rise) until light and puffy - about 20 minutes. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until golden brown. Cool, then cut each bun down the middle, from top to bottom but not all the way through. Split open and fill with cream and jam. Be generous, allowing plenty of jam and no less than 1 oz clotted cream per bun. Then dust with icing sugar.

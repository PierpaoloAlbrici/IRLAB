The sauce should cook at a medium simmer for about 30 minutes. When tomatoes and onion have begun to soften add the seasonings and continue cooking, stirring occasionally till the onions are very soft and translucent. Continue to gently simmer the sauce for another 30 minutes. Run small amounts of the sauce through the blender on high till smooth be careful not to over fill the blender with hot liquid! Then add the blended mix back to the pan. Add the butter after everything is blended. Taste and adjust seasonings.

Mexican oregano is a key ingredient and is available at most grocery stores in the Mexican food aisle.

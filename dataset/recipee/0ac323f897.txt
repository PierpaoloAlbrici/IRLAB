Baguettes (Abm) Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 3 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 2 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 1/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


Instructions: 

Select dough cycle. When complete, punch dough down by starting bread machine, let stir a few seconds, then stop machine. Place on floured work surface and let rest five min. Divide into two balls. Roll each into 10x6 rectangle. Fold dough in half lengthwise, then fold again. Healthy pinch seams together. Place seam side down on baker's peel sprinkled with cornmeal. Cut top of loaf with 1/4" deep diagonal slashes at 2" intervals. Cover and let rise 1 to 1 1/2 hrs. Preheat oven and baking stone to 450 F. Sprinkle stone with cornmeal. Transfer dough from peel to stone. Bake for 22-28 min. Create steam for a crispy crust. NOTE : If using a baking sheet, rather than a baking stone, sprinkle with cornmeal before placing dough on pan, then cover and let rise. NOTES :This recipe is from THE ULTIMATE BREAD MACHINE COOKBOOK by Tom Lacalamita. I noticed in an earlier post, a comment about using lemon juice. Many of the recipes in his book call for lemon juice, I think it really makes a difference. I often add in it to my recipes. Also, do not omit the rye flour. Although it's a small amount, the rye lends a wonderful texture to the bread. This is excellent bread...with or possibly without a banneton!

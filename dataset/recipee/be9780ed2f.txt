Tropical Truffles


Ingredients


 - 2 3/4 pound of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 1/2 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


 - 2/3 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 1 tablespoon of lime juice, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of alcoholic beverage, distilled, rum, 80 proof


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 3 to 4 tablespoon of sugars, powdered


 - 2 tablespoon of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


Instructions: 

Place 1 1/4 pounds of the chocolate in a 2-quart mixing bowl. Combine the cream of coconut, cream, and lime zest in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Strain the mixture into the bowl with the chocolate, let the mixture stand for 1 minute, then blend together thoroughly with a rubber spatula, whisk, or immersion blender. Add the rum and vanilla, and stir to blend well. Cover the truffle cream, let cool to room temperature, and chill in the refrigerator until thick but not stiff (4 to 6 hours). Or let the truffle cream sit at room temperature for several hours or overnight until completely set and thick. Place the truffle cream in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat at medium speed until the mixture thickens and forms light peaks (about 1 minute). Do not beat too long or the mixture will curdle and become grainy. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment or waxed paper. Fit a 12-inch pastry bag with a large, plain round pastry tip with a 1/2-inch opening and fill partway with the truffle cream. Holding the pastry bag 1 inch above the paper, pipe out mounds about 1 inch in diameter. Or use a small ice cream scoop to form the mounds. Cover the mounds with plastic wrap and chill in the freezer for 2 hours or in the refrigerator for 6 hours. Dust your hands with confectioners sugar and roll the mounds into balls. These will be the truffle centers. Cover and chill the centers for another 2 hours in the freezer. Remove the truffle centers from the freezer and bring to coolroom temperature so the outer coating wont crack when they are dipped. Line 2 more baking sheets with parchment or waxed paper. Melt and temper the remaining 1 1/2 pounds chocolate (see pages 2530). Place a truffle center into the tempered chocolate, coating it completely. With a dipper or fork, remove the center from the chocolate, carefully shake off the excess chocolate, and turn the truffle out onto the paper. After dipping 4 truffles, sprinkle a pinch of shredded coconut on top of each truffle before the chocolate sets up. Let the truffles set up at room temperature, or chill them in the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes. When the truffles are set, place them in paper candy cups. In a tightly covered container wrapped in several layers of aluminum foil, the truffles will keep for 1 month in the refrigerator or 2 months in the freezer. The truffles are best served at room temperature. Instead of dipping the truffle centers in chocolate, roll them in a small bowl of confectioners sugar or shredded unsweetened coconut as soon as they are formed into balls.

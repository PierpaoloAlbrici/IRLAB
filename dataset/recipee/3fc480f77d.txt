Plain but Special Pie Crust


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 13 cup of butter, without salt


 - 3 tablespoon of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 18 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


Instructions: 

Mix the flour, baking soda and butter in the food processor or use a pastry cutter or two forks. When the mixture is uniformly granular, add the cold buttermilk -- just enough so that the mixture forms a ball. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for a minimum of 1 hour. Roll out and place in a 9-inch pie plate. Bake according to the recipe instructions.

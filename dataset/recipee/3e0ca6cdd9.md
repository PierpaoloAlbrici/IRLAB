### Ingredients

 - 14 cup of butter, without salt

 - 2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 2 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

 - 2 cup of corn, sweet, white, raw

 - 1 cup of onions, spring or scallions (includes tops and bulb), raw

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

 - 14 cup of parsley, fresh

### Instructions

In a heavy bottom cooking pot, melt butter on medium heat. Add flour and stir gently until blended; DO NOT LET THE MIXTURE DARKEN. Add milk gradually stirring continously until it starts to simmer. Add half and half, stir gently until well blended. Add corn and green onions, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until corn is just tender, stirring occasionally. Add crabmeat, pepper, salt and soy sauce and simmer until very hot and small bubles start to form around the edge of the pot; stir frequently; BUT DO NOT BOIL. Adjust seasonings to taste. Garnish with sprinkles of chopped fresh parsley and serve immediately. If using fresh corn, use 4 large cobs. Cut kernels off cobs, scrape cobs for any milk and add to soup. Canned crabmeat or imitation crabmeat may be used instead of fresh crabmeat. Use 7 1/2 ounces of canned crabmeat (drained) and 8 ounces of imitation crabmeat cut into smaller pieces.

Teething Gel


Ingredients


 - 1 drop of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 ounce of shortening, vegetable, household, composite


Instructions: 

Add 1 drop of the clove oil at a time to the glycerin (you can also use vegetable oil, but it won't stick as well to the gums, and doesn't taste as sweet) and shake until mixed together. Try it yourself before using it on the baby to make sure it isn't too strong.

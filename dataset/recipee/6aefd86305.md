 - 12 cup of cream, sour, cultured

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

Peel potatoes and cut in half. Place in a large saucepan and cover with water. Cover saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Then, reduce heat to medium and boil gently, partially covered, until potatoes are tender, from 20 to 30 minutes. Drain potatoes and mash, preferably with a potato masher. Stir in butter, sour cream, salt and pepper. Stir in cheese just until mixed. Pile into a heated serving dish. Potatoes can be covered and kept warm in oven for up to 30 minutes. Serve sprinkled with chopped parsley or finely sliced green onions, if you wish.

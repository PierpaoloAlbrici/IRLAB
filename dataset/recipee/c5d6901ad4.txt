Homemade Butter Olive Oil Spread


Ingredients


 - 8 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 6 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


Instructions: 

1. Soften butter at room temperature. 2. Blend butter and olive oil at medium speed until well combined. 3. Salt to taste. 4. At this point, the mixture will seem a little runny. Refrigerate until it reaches a spreadable consistency. Tip: This spread is of course great on bread. My family also uses it on baked potatoes.

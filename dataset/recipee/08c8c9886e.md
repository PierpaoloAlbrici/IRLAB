### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of salt, table

 - 5 teaspoon of sauce, hot chile, sriracha

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

### Instructions

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix the salt, sriracha sauce and granulated garlic in a bowl. Spread the mixture out thinly on a baking sheet and allow it to dry slowly, uncovered for a day or two, stirring once or twice during the process. It can then be stored for future use in an airtight container at room temperature. Quicker Method:. Preheat oven to 350*F. Spread the mixture out thinly on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Put the baking sheet in the oven and turn off the heat immediately. Allow the salt to sit in the residual heat until completely dry, usually within 2-3 hours(time will vary depending on different factors). If mixture clumps just put in a plastic bag and run a rolling pin or round glass jar over to break up clumps.

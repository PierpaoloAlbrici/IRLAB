### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat

 - 3/4 cup of honey

 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

### Instructions

This recipe makes approximately 1.5 quarts of frozen yogurt. Start by making sure your blueberries are clean, dry, and picked over for any remaining stems. Place the blueberries, Greek yogurt, half-and-half and honey in a blender. Puree until smooth and creamy. Transfer the mixture into the bowl of an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturers instructions. In my Cuisinart this took 15 minutes, and I added the white chocolate chips after the first 10 minutes of churning. Add the chips whenever your manufacturers instructions say to add the add-ins. You can enjoy this right away and it will be like soft serve ice cream. For a firmer texture transfer the frozen yogurt into an airtight container and freeze for at least 30 minutes. Its best to let let this thaw at room temperature for 10-15 minutes once its been frozen.

Dairy-Free Oil Pastry


Ingredients


 - 1 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 5 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 5 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

In food processor, combine both flours, sugar and salt and pulse to mix. With machine running, add oil in thin, steady stream, about 5 seconds. Remove lid and fluff mixture with fork. Replace lid and pulse again 1 to 2 seconds. Put ice water in measuring cup. With machine running, add 3 tablespoons water in 3-second stream. Stop machine at once, remove lid and fluff again with fork. Replace lid and add remaining 2 tablespoons water with 2-second pulse; pastry will form large crumbs. Turn pastry out onto work surface, scraping bowl thoroughly with rubber spatula. Gently knead 2 or 3 times into ball. Place dough on large sheet of plastic wrap and flatten into 3/4-inch-thick disk; smooth cracked edges. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate 30 to 60 minutes before rolling. Unlike like a butter pastry, dough won't become very firm; this is primarily a rest to ensure easy rolling.

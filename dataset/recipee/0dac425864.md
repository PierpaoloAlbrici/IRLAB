### Ingredients

 - 2/3 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 pound of strawberries, raw

 - 1/2 teaspoon of corn, sweet, white, raw

### Instructions

Combine sugar and water in a large saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook until sugar dissolves; do not stir. Brush down any crystals that form on edges of pan with a wet pastry brush. Cook 2 minutes or until sugar caramelizes and turns pale amber, swirling pan occasionally. Remove pan from heat; let cool 3 minutes. Add strawberries; cover and let stand 10 minutes or until strawberries are tender. Cook over low heat until caramel is liquefied. Stir in peppercorns. Using an immersion blender in pan, puree sauce until smooth. (Sauce will thicken as it cools.)

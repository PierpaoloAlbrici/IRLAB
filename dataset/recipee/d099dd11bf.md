### Ingredients

 - 2 tablespoon of bacon, meatless

 - 3 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 1/2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

Heat Bacon Drippings in a medium skillet on medium low heat. **If you don't have bacon grease/drippings you can substitute with an oil. ** Stir your flour into the melted bacon drippings until well blended and a slight brown tint. Add your salt and pepper Slowly and constantly stir in your milk. Once all milk is stirred in stir for about 3 more minutes until thickened. This makes a thick gravy. To make it thinner add more milk or less flour. This tastes great on Biscuit's, Country Fried Steak or Pork Chops, Mashed Potatoes, Green Bean Casserole, and many other items. Feel free to add other seasonings to it, or use sausage drippings. Enjoy!

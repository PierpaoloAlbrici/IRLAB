TSR Version of Popeyes Red Beans & Rice by Todd Wilbur


Ingredients


 - 30 ounce of beans, kidney, all types, mature seeds, raw


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, paprika


 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 1 1/2 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 1 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


Instructions: 

Pour the beans with their liquid into a large saucepan. Turn the heat to medium. Add the pepper, paprika, butter and garlic powder. When the beans begin to boil, use a fork to mash some of them against the side of the pan. Stir the mixture constantly. In about 20 minutes, the beans will reach the consistency of refried beans. Prepare the rice, using the butter and garlic salt to season instead of per package directions. To serve, pour 1/2 cup of beans into a serving bowl and using an ice-cream scoop, scoop the same amount of rice on top of the beans.

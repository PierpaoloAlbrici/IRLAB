### Ingredients

 - 1 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 cup of lime juice, raw

 - 12 cup of syrups, corn, light

 - 34 cup of spices, basil, dried

 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 tablespoon of lime juice, raw

### Instructions

Combine sugar, 1 cup juice, and corn syrup in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook 2 minutes or until sugar melts, stirring constantly. Stir in basil. Cook 30 seconds. Remove from heat. Pour mixture into a bowl. Add remaining 1 cup juice, 2 cups water, and 1 tablespoon rind. Cover and chill. Strain mixture through a fine sieve; discard solids. Pour mixture into a freezer can of an ice-cream freezer; freeze according to manufacturer's instructions. Spoon mixture into a freezer-safe container; cover and freeze 1 hour or until firm. Garnish with finely grated rind, if desired. A traditional salt and ice electric freezer works best for this sorbet, as opposed to a tabletop freezer, which might not freeze the mixture firmly enough.

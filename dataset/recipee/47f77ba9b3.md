### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of sweet potato, raw, unprepared

 - 1 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Peel the sweet potato and slice into 1/2"-thick rounds. Heat the oil in a medium-sized saucepan; when it's hot, add the brown sugar to the oil. I know it's weird - but it works :). When the brown sugar floats, add the slice sweet potato and fry about 10 minutes, turning every once in a while to get the brown sugar all over the potato. When the potato is tender, remove from pan and let it cool off a few minutes - that sugar is HOT. You can serve this on a plate, or on a bamboo skewer.

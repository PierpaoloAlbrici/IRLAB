Chocolate Covered Strawberry Ice Cream


Ingredients


 - 16 ounce of strawberries, raw


 - 3 1/2 tablespoon of sweetener, herbal extract powder from stevia leaf


 - 2 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

Blend the strawberries, Truvia, and half & half in a blender until smooth. (This will require stopping and stirring the mixture as you go to ensure all strawberries get fully blended. ). Place in ice cream machine until appropriately thickened. (This will not take long due to partially frozen consistency from blender. ). Melt chocolate chips by microwaving them 10 seconds at a time and stirring between 10 second cooks. After about 50 seconds (YMMV), you will be able to stir the chips into smooth melted chocolate. Take care not to over heat the chocolate. Transfer the ice cream from the machine to its container. Slowly pour the melted chocolate into the ice cream while stirring. This will create thick hard chocolate swirls. The faster you mix, the thinner the chocolate swirls will be. Place in freezer until ready.

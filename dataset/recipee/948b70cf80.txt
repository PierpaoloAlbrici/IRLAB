Griddle Cakes


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of rice flour, white, unenriched


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Mix all ingredients. Let rest for 6 to 8 hours to ferment. (Cover bowl and leave on counter.) Using a small non-stick frying pan, ladle about 1/4 cup of batter into the pan, and thinly spread. Bubbles will form immediately. Do not turn until the cake has dried out a little. Loosen gently and turn to cook on other side. The first side takes about 1 1/2 minutes, the other side about 1 minute at medium temperature. Serve with a bean mixture spooned over them, or use like a crepe.

Cobble Topped Blackberries


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of blackberries, raw


 - 3/4 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1 teaspoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2/3 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Combine the blackberries, 1/4 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon of flour in a mixing bowl. Allow it to sit until the berries begin to soften and juices flow, about 3 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, grease 6 (8-ounce) ramekins using 2 tablespoons butter and arrange them on a baking sheet. Divide the berries among the ramekins. Cut 1 cup of butter into cubes and freeze. In a bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 cup sugar, remaining 1/2 cup of flour, the cornmeal and the salt. Cut in the butter with a fork to make a pea-like texture and sprinkle it on top of the berries in the ramekins. Bake until the berries bubble and the topping is baked to a light golden color, approximately 25 to 30 minutes.

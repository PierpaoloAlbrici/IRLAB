Miquelita's Tortillas


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1/4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

In a large bowl place the white flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder and salt. Mix the ingredients together well. Add the oil, milk, and water. Mix the ingredients together so that they are well blended and a dough is formed. On a floured surface, knead the dough for 2 minutes. With oiled hands, form twelve 2-inch balls by rolling some of the dough in your palms. Roll out each ball so that it forms a 18 inch thick circle. On a heated grill place the tortillas. Cook them for 2 minutes on each side, or until they are done.

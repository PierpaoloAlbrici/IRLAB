Spinach and goat cheese pizza


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 2 1/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/4 cup of cheese, goat, soft type


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, oregano, dried


Instructions: 

Add all of the ingredients in order and mix until the dough pulls away from the bowl. Turn onto a floured surface and knead until it becomes soft and stretchy. This takes about 5-10 minutes. Transfer the dough into an oiled bowl and cover with a towel. Keep the bowl in a warm draft free place to rise. Wash and dry spinach and set aside. When the dough has doubled in size cut into two and roll/stretch it into a thin circle. Place onto an oiled and floured pizza pan. Drizzle a little bit of olive oil on the dough and spread the chopped garlic. Then add the spinach and crumble the goat cheese over top. Drizzle with a little bit more olive oil. Bake at 400 for 10-15 minutes or until edges are slightly golden. Just before the edges brown add fresh basil leaves. Cut with a pizza cutter and serve hot.

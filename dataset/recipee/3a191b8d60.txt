Healthy Nutella Rice


Ingredients


 - 14 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 14 cup of nuts, hazelnuts or filberts


 - 18 cup of raisins, seeded


 - 1 teaspoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, canola


Instructions: 

Soak raisins in 1/4 cup water for about 1 hour. Roast hazelnuts in preheated oven at 350 degrees F for about 10-12 minutes. Remove nuts from baking sheet and place on a tea towel. Rub them in the tea towel until most of the skins are removed. Cook brown rice according to package directions. While rice is cooking, drain raisins, reserving the water. Place raisins, hazelnuts, canola oil, cocoa powder and half of the soaking water in a food processor and process until smooth, adding the rest of the soaking water if necessary. Mix hazelnut paste and boiled rice, add 1 teaspoon honey if you want it sweeter. Enjoy!

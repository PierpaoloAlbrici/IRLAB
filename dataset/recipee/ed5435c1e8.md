### Ingredients

 - 1/2 pound of cranberries, dried, sweetened

 - 1 pound of apples, raw, with skin

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

Rinse cranberries and place in large heavy-bottomed saucepan with apples and water; bring to a boil. Stir in sugar. Reduce heat to medium and cook till cranberries have burst and mix has begun to thicken, about 20 min. Remove from heat and serve at room temperature. NOTES : Grilled chicken breast and roasted new potatoes are perfect companions to this full-flavored sauce, that can also be used in place or possibly jams or possibly jellies and served with toast or possibly swirled into plain yogurt. Will keep for up to 1 week in refrigerator.

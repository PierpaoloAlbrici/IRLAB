Cranberry-Orange Buttermilk Scones


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 13 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 34 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 34 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 1 cup of cranberries, dried, sweetened


 - 1 teaspoon of orange juice, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


Instructions: 

In a bowl, combine the flour, 1/3 cup sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. Cut in butter till crumbly. Stir in buttermilk gently until just combined. Fold in cranberries and orange peel. Turn onto a floured surface and divide into two balls. Pat each ball into a six inch circle and place on a lightly greased baking sheet. Cut each into six wedges, leaving them together on the pan. Brush with milk, then sprinkle on the sugar combined with the cinnamon. Bake in a 400 degree oven for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. You can also cut them into circles with a round cookie cutter, but the baking time will be less if you place them on the baking sheet not touching each other.

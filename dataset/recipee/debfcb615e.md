### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 34 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 14 cup of sugars, brown

 - 2 cup of pretzels, soft, unsalted

 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

### Instructions

Line an 8x8 or 9x9 inch baking dish with aluminum foil and spray with non-stick cooking spray. (I used the butter wrappers to grease but did not put any foil in the pan). In the bowl of a stand mixer or with an electric mixer, beat together 3/4 cup peanut butter, butter, and vanilla extract until creamy. Add confectioners' sugar and brown sugar. Slowly beat sugars into peanut butter until well-combined. Add 1 1/2 cup pretzels and beat to combine. Press mixture into the bottom of prepared baking dish. In a microwave safe bowl, melt together chocolate chips and remaining 1/4 cup peanut butter. Stir until smooth. Pour over the top and smooth with a spatula. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup of crushed pretzels. Press down lightly. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before cutting into bars and serving.

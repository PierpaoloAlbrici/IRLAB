Cinnamon Pancakey Bread


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 1/4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 3 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 14 cup of egg substitute, powder


Instructions: 

Set oven to 350. Grease 11 x 7-inch baking dish, or two 8-inch round cake pans (athough the batter will seem like it will fit into one 8-inch pan, this flop rises very high and will run over the sides if baked in just one pan, you could even bake it in a 13 x 9-inch). In a bowl, mix all ingredients, except the brown sugar and cinnamon. Pour into prepared baking pan(s). Spread brown sugar and cinnamon on top. Bake for 20-25 minutes.

Sunday's Yummy Healthier Almost Creamed Spinach


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of spinach, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 12 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, onion powder


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


Instructions: 

In a skillet or pan add the spinach with the rest of the ingredients. Turn the stovetop on medium. Stir the spinach every so often to mix the spinach and the rest of the ingredients together making sure the parmesan gets evenly distributed. After about 20 minutes on medium (if you choose to use that heat setting), the parmesan, butter and spinach should be warm, melted and thoroughly mixed. Serve and enjoy :).

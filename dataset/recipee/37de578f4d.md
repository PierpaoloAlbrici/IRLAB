### Ingredients

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

 - 8 ounce of lemonade, frozen concentrate, white, prepared with water

### Instructions

Grate your preferred amount of ground ginger. (I used about a teaspoon and 1/2). Put your grated ginger in a tea filter/strainer and Boil about 1/4 of a glass of water. Once your water is boiled, place tea filter/strainer with ginger in it into a mug. Pour water in so it just covers the top of the ginger. Steep for about 10 minutes. While ginger is steeping, pour about a 1/2 a glassful of (strawberry) lemonade. When the ginger is done steeping, cool the ginger mixture down to room temperature by either putting it in the freezer or refrigerator. When ginger is to room temperature, pour into the strawberry lemonade and mix. Cool to room temperature and serve!

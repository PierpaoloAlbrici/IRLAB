Baked Beef Tenderloin With Diane Sauce


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 pound of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw


 - 1 cup of soup, beef broth or bouillon canned, ready-to-serve


 - 2 teaspoon of cornstarch


 - 1 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 14 cup of onions, spring or scallions (includes tops and bulb), raw


 - 14 cup of parsley, fresh


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 2 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

Heat oven to 400. Place sheet of foil on 15 X 10 X 1-inch baking pan or cookie sheet. Place beef tenderloin on foil; tuck narrow end under. Turn edges of foil up around tenderloin to contain juices. Bake at 400 for 30-40 minutes for medium doneness. Meanwhile, in small bowl, combine broth and cornstarch; blend well. Set aside. Heat oil in small nonstick skillet until hot. Add onions; cook about 1 minute. Stir in parsley, pepper, mustard, and lemon juice. Add cornstarch mixture; cook and stir over medium heat for 4 - 6 minutes or until sauce is bubbly and slightly thickened. To serve, cut tenderloin into 1/2-inch slices. Serve sauce over slices.

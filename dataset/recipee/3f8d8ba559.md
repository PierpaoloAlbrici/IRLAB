### Ingredients

 - 1 1/4 cup of cookies, vanilla wafers, lower fat

 - 1/2 cup of nuts, pecans

 - 13 cup of butter, without salt

 - 3 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 13 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 8 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 3/4 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 20 ounce of raspberries, raw

 - 1/2 cup of jams and preserves, apricot

### Instructions

Crust: Combine all ingredients except chocolate chips. Mix until blended. Pat mixture on the bottom and sides of a buttered 9 inch pie pan. Bake at 350F (180C) for about 8 minutes. Sprinkle the chocolate chips on top and return to oven for 1 minute to melt chocolate. Remove from oven and spread melted chocolate evenly on crust, forming a thin chocolate layer. Set aside to cool. Beat together the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy. In a separate bowl, beat the cream until it is stiff. On the lowest speed, beat the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until blended. Pour into prepared crust. Stir together the raspberries and melted jam until fruit is evenly coated. Gently spread raspberries over cream mixture. Refrigerate.

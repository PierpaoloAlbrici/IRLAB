### Ingredients

 - 12 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 12 cup of oats

 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 ounce of apples, raw, with skin

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

In a small pot that has a tight fitting lid, melt the butter over medium-high heat and stir in the steel cut oats. Stirring, brown the oats until you smell a nutty aroma coming from the pot. Slowly pour in the boiling water and stir to fully incorporate the browned oats. Stir in the dried apple bits and reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cover with a lid and cook for 30 minutes. When 30 minutes is up, stir in the remaining ingredients, slowly and remove from the heat. (NOTE: Depending on the kind of pot you use, there may be some bits baked to the bottom of the pan. These taste good and should be scraped up with a spoon and mixed in with the rest of the dish. ). Serve hot.

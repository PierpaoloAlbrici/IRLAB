Peanut Butter Cups


Ingredients


 - 4 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 1/2 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 12 ounce of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, corn, peanut, and olive


Instructions: 

Line two 12-cup mini muffin pans with paper liners; set aside. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine white chocolate and peanut butter. Microwave, until almost melted, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, stirring halfway through. Set aside to cool slightly. Meanwhile, place semisweet chocolate in another microwave-safe bowl. Microwave, stirring once or twice, until almost melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Dividing evenly, use a spoon to layer semisweet chocolate and peanut butter mixtures into the liners, beginning and ending with chocolate; then sprinkle with peanuts. Place muffin pans in freezer until peanut butter cups are firm, about 15 minutes. Bring to room temperature before serving.

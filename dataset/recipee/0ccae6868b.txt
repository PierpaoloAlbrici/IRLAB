Basic Simple Pizza Crust


Ingredients


 - 2 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 14 ounce of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 2 tablespoon of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow


Instructions: 

Sift together 1 cup flour, yeast & salt. Add water & mix well (I like to use a pastry blender but its not necessary. ). Slowly, 1/2 cup at a time, add in the rest of the flour. Pour oil over dough and knead before shaping into a ball. Put someplace warm to rise for 15 minutes. Sprinkle corn meal over warm baking stone or over pizza sheet and roll dough out. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes. Top and bake as is your preference. These are some other variations:. Add Italian Seasoning to the dough before setting to rise. Add chunks of cheese or shredded cheese while adding in the water. Use wheat flour in place or white flour. Roll pieces of string cheese into the edges to form stuft crust pizza (one of my hubby's faves).

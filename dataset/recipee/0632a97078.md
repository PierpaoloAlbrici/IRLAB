### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of catsup

 - 1 cup of tomato sauce, canned, no salt added

 - 1 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1/4 cup of vinegar, distilled

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1/2 cup of molasses

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, chili powder

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

### Instructions

In a medium-sized pot over medium heat, mix all of the ingredients until combined. Bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, then simmer for 45-60 minutes (the longer you simmer, the thicker the sauce will be), stirring occasionally until the sauce has reduced and thickened. Let cool slightly before serving, and enjoy!

### Ingredients

 - 200 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 4 g of salt, table

 - 5 g of sugars, granulated

 - 2 g of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 140 ml of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Place the flour, salt, sugar, and yeast into a bowl. Pour in the warm water all at once and use long chopsticks to mix. Switch to a spatula and knead the dough 20-30 times. (You don't have to put too much effort into this). Cover with plastic wrap and let rise. Leave as is for 6 hours. When the dough has doubled in size, remove from the bowl and form into a smooth ball. Let rest for 20 minutes. Gently spread it out into a rectangle. (Please dust with flour) Fold over one side 1/3 of the way towards the center. Fold the side nearest to you as well. Close the seam in the center. Flip it over and shape it. (Make sure it's plump.) Let rise a second time for 40 minutes. Be careful not to let the dough dry out. Preheat the oven to 250C. When the second rising is complete, dust with flour through a strainer and then score the top. Spray with water about 10 times and then quickly place in the oven. Lower the temperature to 210 and bake for 19~20 minutes. It's done! It looks like this when it's cut. It contains no egg, milk, or butter, but it's still so fluffy and delicious.

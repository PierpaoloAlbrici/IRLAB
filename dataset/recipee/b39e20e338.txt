Baked Old Fashioned Rice Pudding


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 250 ml of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Boil rice until done. Place cooked rice in a baking dish. Add milk, water, butter, (add as much as you like I do 2 tbsp ) sugar. Stir all of it together and bake until done about 1 hr at 350 degrees. The water measurement is done with the can from the milk so 1 cup is a guess.

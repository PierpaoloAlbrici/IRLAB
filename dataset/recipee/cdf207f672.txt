Balsamic Strawberry Milkshake


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of strawberries, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of vinegar, balsamic


 - 1 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


 - 1/4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

First prepare the strawberries. Remove the cap and slice the berries. Place them in a bowl and sprinkle with the sugar and the vinegar. Let sit at least 1 hour or a little longer if you can stand it! Dump the strawberries and ice cream in your blender/smoothie maker. Add the milk, a little at a time, until the milkshake has reached your desired thickness. Depending on how much juice the berries have produced, you may not need much of the milk.

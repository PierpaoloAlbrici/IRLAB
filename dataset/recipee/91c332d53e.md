### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

To roast the almonds:. Spread them in a thin layer on a baking sheet. Bake at 300 degrees F for about 20 minutes. Stir a couple of times to assure even roasting. Making the butter:. Combine the almonds and salt in a food processor, blender, meat grinder or nut butter machine and process until the nuts are finely ground. Add the oil and continue processing until the almond butter reaches your desired degree of smoothness, adding more oil if necessary. For chunky butter, stir in 1/4 cup chopped almonds. Store, tightly covered, in the refrigerator. Variations: Substitute Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts or macadamia nuts for the almonds. Or combine two or more of these nuts in any proportion.

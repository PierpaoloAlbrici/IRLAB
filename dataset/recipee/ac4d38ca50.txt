Jumbo Peanut Spiral Cookies


Ingredients


 - 3 1/8 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 34 cup of butter, without salt


 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 38 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 4 1/2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 38 cup of sugars, brown


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 3 1/2 ounce of oil, corn, peanut, and olive


Instructions: 

For the filling: chop peanuts and mix in a bowl with brown sugar and cinnamon; set aside. Put flour, butter, sugar, salt and peanut butter into food processor. Mix until small pieces are formed. Add water and mix until it just holds together. Turn out on a floured flat surface and knead dough with floured hands one or two times just that dough holds together. Divide it into two parts. Layer plastic wrap on surface and well first part of dough with a floured rolling pin to a size of approximately 8.5 x 12.5 inches; set aside. Do the same with the second part of the dough. Sprinkle the filling onto this part of the dough. Cover it with the other part of the dough. Roll up from the short side to form a spiral. The plastic wrap will be of help. For Jumbo spirals roll up from the long side (a little bit tricky). Cover in plastic wrap and put into the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile preheat oven (390F/200C). Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Take spiral out of the fridge and cut with a long knife into 1/4 - 1/2 inch thick slices. Before each cutting put knife into very hot water. Place spirals on baking paper with the aid of a cake shovel. Bake for 15-20 minutes until slightly to light golden brown. Take tray out of the oven and let cool spirals on tray for 5 minutes. Using a cake shovel remove spirals from tray and let cool completely. NOTE: the roll up and forming of the spiral as well as the cutting into slices can sometimes be a little bit tricky, be patient. Cooking time is chill time and baking time.

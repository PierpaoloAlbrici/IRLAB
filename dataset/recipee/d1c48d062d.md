### Ingredients

 - 6-8 ounce of cheese, brie

 - 1 cup of cherries, sweet, raw

 - 14 cup of sugars, brown

 - 12 cup of nuts, almonds

### Instructions

Remove wrapping from brie, and also the rind if desired. Place the brie inside an oven-safe casserole dish or serving platter that has been lightly greased. ( I use cooking spray). Toast the slivered almonds until golden brown and aromatic (350 degrees, ungreased pan, ten minutes OR add almonds to 1 T. butter and microwave for 4-5 minutes) Regardless of your method, stir them several times while toasting. Mix preserves and brown sugar. Pour over the brie. Top with toasted almonds. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 10-15 minutes, or until it starts to look gooey. Serve with toasted baguette slices, crackers or apple slices.

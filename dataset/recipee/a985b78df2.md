### Ingredients

 - 12 ounce of spices, cardamom

 - 18 ounce of spices, coriander seed

 - 5 ounce of spices, cumin seed

 - 1 ounce of spices, cloves, ground

 - 2 ounce of corn, sweet, white, raw

 - 1 ounce of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground

### Instructions

Heat oven to 350 deg F/180 deg Celsius. Spread the mix of spices in an oven dish or tin, and roast lightly for about 7 - 10 minutes. This brings out the flavours. Grind all together -- a blender is best, but a coffee bean grinder also does a great job. Store in an airtight container out of direct light. Use as recipes indicate.

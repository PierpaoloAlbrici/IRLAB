Sweet Orange Kale Chips


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of kale, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of orange juice, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Wash, dry, and de-vein the kale. Shred it to the size you would like your chips to be. Toss kale with the other ingredients until all the leaves are evenly coated. Spread out the kale in a single, even layer on 2 baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Bake for 4 to 6 minutes, until chips have turned patchy brown and green. Leave your oven light on, and check them constantly. Remove the chips at the edges of the baking sheets as they brown. The ones in the center may take a bit longer to cook. Let them cool for a few minutes before munching away; this allows the sugar to harden and the slightly soft parts of the chips to become crispy. Enjoy!

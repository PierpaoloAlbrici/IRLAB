### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

 - 2 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 teaspoon of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Bring water, salt, and butter to a boil. Stir in rice with a fork. Bring back to a boil, then cut heat to simmer, to prevent "boiling over". (Do not be tempted to remove lid -- this can cause gummy rice. ). Cover and cook for 45 minutes.

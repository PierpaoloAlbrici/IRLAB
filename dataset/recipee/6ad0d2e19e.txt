Broccoli Cheese Soup


Ingredients


 - 5 cup of broccoli, raw


 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1/2 cup of onions, raw


 - 3 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 cup of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry


 - 2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 4 ounce of cheese, cheddar


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Put the broccoli in a microwave-safe bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Microwave on high for 5 minutes, until tender but still crunchy. Melt butter in a medium-sized pot and add the onions. Cook until translucent, about 10 minutes. Add in the flour and whisk for 1 minute. While continuing to whisk, slowly add the chicken stock and milk, so the flour combines nicely. Add in the broccoli and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and add the cheese, salt and pepper. Transfer to a blender, or use an immersion blender, and puree until no chunks of broccoli remain. Portion into bowls, and top with more cheese. Enjoy!

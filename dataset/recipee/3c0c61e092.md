### Ingredients

 - 4 pound of plums, raw

 - 4 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 1 1/2 cup of tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average

### Instructions

Sterilize 4 1-pt. canning jars and lids by boiling jars 10 minutes in large pot of water and simmering new lids in small separate saucepan 15 minutes. Leave jars and lids in simmering water until ready to use. Score shallow X on bottom of each tomato. Working in batches, blanch tomatoes 1 to 2 minutes in large pot of boiling water. Transfer to large bowl of cold water. Remove tomato skins and cores, and cut in half over bowl to catch tomato juice. Measure 1 Tbs. lemon juice into bottom of each jar. Pack tomato halves in sterilized jars. Bring prepared tomato juice and reserved fresh tomato juice to a simmer in small saucepan over medium heat. Pour hot tomato juice over tomatoes in jars, leaving 1/2 inch of headspace. Using a knife or wooden chopstick, remove any air bubbles. Wipe rims, seal jars with lids, and process in boiling water bath 1 hour 25 minutes. Remove jars from boiling water bath with tongs, and cool on counter. When jars are cool enough to handle, test seals. Unsealed jars should be refrigerated and used within 1 month.

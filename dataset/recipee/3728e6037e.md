### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 tablespoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 4 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 5 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

In a large bowl mix the warm water, sugar, the yeast, and a cup of flour. Mix it with a spoon until smooth. Let stand for about 15 minutes - you should start to see the yeast begin to work. Mix in the oil and the salt. Start adding the rest of the flour, mixing until it is incorporated and the dough comes together. Turn out onto a floured surface (I usually use an oiled surface for kneading) and knead until you have a smooth dough, about 10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, cover and let stand in a warm place until the dough is doubled. Turn out of bowl onto floured surface. Deflate the dough by kneading gently and let rest 15 minutes. Divide dough into six pieces and shape each piece into a rope. Braid three pieces into a loaf; repeat with remaining pieces. Place each braid into a greased loaf pan, cover and let rise until nearly doubled. Preheat oven to 400 deg F (200 deg C) Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Turn out of pans and brush with a little oil.

Rugelach Tortes


Ingredients


 - 8 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 12 cup of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 9 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 14 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 34 cup of raisins, seeded


 - 1 cup of nuts, pistachio nuts, raw


 - 12 cup of apricots, dried, sulfured, uncooked


Instructions: 

Cream the cheese and butter until light. Add 1/4 cup granulated sugar, the salt, and vanilla. On low speed, add the flour and mix until just combined. Dump the dough out onto a well-floured board and roll it into a ball. Cut the ball in quarters, wrap each piece in plastic, and refrigerate for 1 hour. To make the filling, combine 6 tablespoons of granulated sugar, the brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, the raisins, and pistachios. On a well-floured board, roll each ball of dough into a 9-inch circle. Using a cup or glass, cut circles into the dough. Place the circles in the bottom of a cupcake pan or mini torte pan. Spread the tortes with equal amounts of apricot preserves and sprinkle each with 1 heaping tsp of the filling. Press the filling lightly into the dough. Chill for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350F. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until lightly browned. Remove to a wire rack and let cool.

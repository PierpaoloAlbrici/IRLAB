Rosemary Rum Raisin Soda Bread with Pecans


Ingredients


 - 13 cup of alcoholic beverage, distilled, rum, 80 proof


 - 1/2 cup of raisins, seeded


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, rosemary, dried


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 1 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


 - 1 tablespoon of honey


 - 1 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 3/4 teaspoon of oats


Instructions: 

Combine the rum and raisins in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil. Simmer for 30 seconds, then remove from heat. Cover the pan and allow the raisins to macerate for at least 4 hours, but preferably overnight. When youre ready to bake the bread, preheat the oven to 375 F. Coat a baking sheet with olive oil and lightly dust it with flour, or line it with parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl whisk together the flours, baking soda, salt, and rosemary. Stir in the toasted pecans. Set aside. In a separate bowl combine the raisin and rum mixture with the yogurt and honey. Add the wet ingredients into the dry. Mix until the dough is too stiff to stir. Use your hands to bring it together in the bowl. Add additional yogurt one teaspoon at a time if its too dry. You want a stiff, slightly tacky ball. Turn dough onto a lightly floured board and shape it into a round loaf. (Dont over-knead the dough. Too much kneading will produce a tough bread). Transfer the loaf to the prepared baking sheet. Use a sharp knife to make deep slashes across the top of the loaf, 4-6 cuts about half way through. Brush the top of the loaf with milk. Sprinkle with seeds or oats if using. Bake at 375 F for 40-45 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. When you tap the loaf, it will sound hollow. Cool on a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature with a generous slather of butter.

Cherry Sauce


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 cup of cherries, sweet, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of orange juice, raw


 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of cherries, sweet, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of cornstarch


 - 1 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

In a blender or food processor, combine cherries & orange Juice, then cover & process until smooth. If it's necessary for the sauce to be REALLY smooth, strain the cherry mixture in a sieve over a bowl, then discard the pulp. (I usually don't do this step, however,). In a saucepan, combine 1/2 cup water, sugar & brandy (if using). Place over medium-high heat & cook until sugar dissolves, stirring constantly. Add the cherry mixture to the sugar water & stir well, then bring it to a boil, reduce heat & simmer 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. In a small container, dissolve cornstarch in 1 tablespoon of water, then stir it into the cherry mixture, bring to a boil & cook another minute or until slightly thick. Serve warm over pudding, pound cake, ice cream, whatever.

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 4 tablespoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 4 tablespoon of chickpeas (garbanzo beans, bengal gram), mature seeds, raw

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

### Instructions

Mix the sugar, cocoa, besan (gram flour), and salt together in the pot you will be cooking inches Make sure there are no clumps, and everything is mixed evenly. Add the water. Stir until all the dry ingredients are incorporated. Set the pot over medium-low heat, and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Continue to boil for one minute, stirring all the while. When it is looking like it's almost as thick as you'd like it, take it off the heat and stir in the oil and vanilla or creamer. The frosting will thicken slightly as it cools. Yields at least enough for an 8 x 8 inch pan of brownies :-).

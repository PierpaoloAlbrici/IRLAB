Homemade Coconut Milk


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


Instructions: 

Bring the 2 cups of water to a boil. Put the coconut in a blender. Pour the water into the blender. Use a towel to hold the lid on tight. Pulse the blender to get it going, then blend for about 30 seconds, until smooth. Let rest for 10 minutes. Pour through a strainer. The milk will be fairly thick, if you want more milk, just pour up to another 2 cups of water through the coconut. Press the coconut to extract as much liquid as possible.

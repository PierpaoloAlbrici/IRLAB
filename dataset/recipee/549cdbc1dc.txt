Diana's Favourite Caramel Corn


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of sugars, brown


 - 12 cup of syrups, corn, light


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 14 teaspoon of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 6 quart of corn, sweet, white, raw


Instructions: 

In a large pot, combine sugar, corn syrup, butter, cream of tartar and salt. Boil rapidly on medium high heat, stirring constantly until mixture reaches 260 on a candy thermometer. Remove from heat. Stir in soda thoroughly. Pour over popped corn in a large bowl. Stir until well coated. Place popcorn on a large buttered cookie sheet. Bake for 1 hour at 200, stirring 3 or 4 times. Keep in a tightly covered container. Care should be taken not to get the caramel on your skin. Trust me -- I know the consequences.

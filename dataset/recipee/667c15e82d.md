### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of salt, table

 - 2 tablespoon of salt, table

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, thyme, dried

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cumin seed

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, paprika

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 4 pound of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw

### Instructions

Combine all the dry ingredients and mix together. Generously sprinkle the mixture onto the tri-tip or chicken and let it sit, covered, overnight in the refrigerator. Just before grilling, rub the mixture a second time all over the tri-tip or chicken, making sure all sides are coated with the seasoning. Grill the tri-tip until the internal temperature reaches 130 degrees F, or the chicken reaches 160 degrees F. Let the tri-tip or chicken rest at least 10 minutes before slicing.

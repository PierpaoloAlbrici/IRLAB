Rosemary Roasted Potatoes


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 3/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, rosemary, dried


 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Leave smaller potatoes whole and cut larger potatoes in half lengthwise so that theyre even in size. Toss the potatoes in olive oil and salt, coating evenly. Place on a sheet tray (no parchment paper) with cut sides down, leaving space between each potato. Cook 30 minutes or until cut sides are golden-brown and potatoes are fork tender. While still hot, use a spatula to assist in removing from tray; toss with rosemary, lemon juice and cracked black pepper.

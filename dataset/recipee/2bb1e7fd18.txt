Possible Soda Bread


Ingredients


 - 1 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 cup of oats


 - 14 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 14 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 1/2 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 425. Put baking sheet in the oven until it is warm, but not too hot so the burnt stuff won't start re-burning. Mix all of the ingredients together in a large bowl except for the butter and yogurt. Take the mini butter stick and a butter knife, and shave small peices of butter into the bowl. Using your fingers, crumble the butter up until the flour mixture is about evenly crumbly. Check the oven. If it's almost ready, go on to the next step. If not, take a break for a few minutes. Go watch Rachael Ray or something. This step is important because you want the yogurt to react with the baking soda soon before those are put in the oven. Pour the yogurt into the flour mixture and mix swiftly and evenly. Turn out dough onto lightly floured surface and knead for about 30 seconds; if you aren't extremely good, it will not look perfect but most of the dough should be in one pile. Shape the dough lump into an appealing shape and plop it onto the pan. If you want to be fancy, sprinkle some flour over the top of the bread. Pop it in the oven and bake for about 30 minutes. When the bread is done, it will be hollow when you tap the bottom. Cool then cut!

### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw

 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of spices, chili powder

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cumin seed

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 12 cup of fresh red onions, upc: 888670013229

 - 12 cup of catsup

 - 14 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

In a small pot, combine the ketchup, water, and spices and bring to a simmer. Let cook for about ten minutes at a fast simmer. The sauce should reduce by half. Remove the sauce from the stove and let cool. In a large bowl, combine the beef and sauce with the onion and mix well. If your mixture seems too soupy, keep mixing it. It will incorporate into the meat. Form the meat into four equal patties and grill as desired. Dress your burgers with cheese and enjoy.

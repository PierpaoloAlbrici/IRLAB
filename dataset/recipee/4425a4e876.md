### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of sugars, brown

 - 13 cup of syrups, corn, light

 - 13 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 12 cup of nuts, walnuts, english

### Instructions

Butter a 9-inch square pan and set aside. In a heavy saucepan, combine sugar, corn syrup, milk and butter and then bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly to dissolve sugar. Insert a candy thermometer so that it doesn't touch the bottom of the pan and cook, without stirring, until temperature reaches 238F (115C) or soft-ball-stage, watching very carefully during the final minutes of cooking. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla and the nuts, if using. With a wooden spoon and a lot of elbow grease, beat fudge until it begins to thicken, about 7 to 10 minutes. Pour into prepared pan and let cool; score with a sharp knife into squares or bars before the fudge is fully set.

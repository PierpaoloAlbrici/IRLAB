### Ingredients

 - 2 pound of potatoes, raw, skin

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 34 teaspoon of spices, paprika

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 2 tablespoon of cheese, parmesan, hard

### Instructions

Leave potatoes whole. Place in steamer basket over water in a dutch oven. Cover and bring to a boil. Steam over low boil for about 25 minutes, or until just tender. Remove potatoes from steamer and let cool. If doing ahead, cover and refrigerate at this point. Preheat oven to 425F Put potatoes in large bowl and toss with seasonings and olive oil. transfer to a baking sheet (I use a jelly roll pan). Place a piece of plastic wrap loosely over potatoes. Using a small heavy saucepan, gently smash each potato under the plastic wrap to flatten to about 1/2" thick. Remove plastic wrap and arrange potatoes uniformly in the pan. Scrape any remaining seasoned oil out of the bowl and drizzle over the potatoes. Sprinkle lightly with additional kosher salt. Roast in oven for 20-25 minutes. If using parmesan, sprinkle on for last 5 minutes of baking.

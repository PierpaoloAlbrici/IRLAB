Scottish Soda Bread


Ingredients


 - 2 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, caraway seed


 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 375F. Sprinkle flour on any round or square cake pan or pie plate and set aside. Place the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and caraway seeds (if using) in a large mixing bowl. Add the butter and work it in with your fingertips until the mixture is crumbly and even in texture. Add the buttermilk and stir with a wooden spoon just long enough to moisten the dry ingredients. Knead the mixture in the bowl for a minute. (The purpose of the kneading is not to develop gluten, as with yeast dough, but simply to mix the dough thoroughly-so dont overdo it.) If the dough is too sticky to handle, add a little more flour. Shape the dough into a ball about 8 inches in diameter and place on the prepared pan. Dip a sharp knife in flour and use it to make two deep cuts into the loaf (almost-but not quite-to the bottom) in the shape of a plus sign. As the bread bakes, the cuts will spread apart. Bake for about 30 to 40 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and spread out like an open flower. Cool on a wire rack. To serve, pull the bread apart at the cut lines and tear off pieces.

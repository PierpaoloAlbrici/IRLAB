Place rice in a bowl and rinse with water by stirring in a counter clockwise motion. Do this repeatedly until the water is clear and clean, indicating the rice is clean. Pick out any odd grains. In a medium saucepan, stir rice, salt, sugar and water and bring to a boil. Stir well and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer gently for 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours until all of the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Stir in the coconut milk and serve immediately as a hot dish. Or chill and serve cold.

### Ingredients

 - 8 ounce of cream, sour, cultured

 - 2 ounce of horseradish, prepared

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/2 teaspoon of sauce, worcestershire

### Instructions

Mix sour cream, horseradish, salt, and Worcestershire. Taste, and add more salt or Worcestershire sauce if desired. This sauce can be made ahead up to 3 days. The longer it rests, the better it gets! Serving suggestion: Cook rib-eye steaks for 4 minutes on each side to medium rare, then let rest for 10 minutes. Thinly slice, and serve with lots of horseradish cream.

Almond Butter Cups


Ingredients


 - 14 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 12 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 200 g of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022


Instructions: 

Mix vanilla extract and salt into your almond butter. Using a teaspoon make six flat roundish patties of almond butter. Set aside. Fill 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of melted chocolate into each of six cavities of a silicone muffin mold. Place one of the almond butter patties on top of each chocolate puddle. Top that with another 2 teaspoons of melted chocolate each smoothing out the tops and making sure that the almond butter is covered. Place in the fridge until hardened (I left mine over night). Pop out of the muffin tin and enjoy.

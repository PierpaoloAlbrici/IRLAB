Low Fat Zesty Potato Topper


Ingredients


 - 34 cup of cheese, cottage, creamed, large or small curd


 - 3 tablespoon of cheese, cheddar


 - 2 tablespoon of cream, sour, cultured


 - 2 teaspoon of bacon, meatless


 - 2 teaspoon of onions, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 34 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Put everything into a food processor. Pulse until well mixed and smooth. If you want it more creamy, add sour cream a tablespoon at a time. This makes a lot, but we keep it in the fridge for about a week and end up using it all. Heats up in the microwave well too.

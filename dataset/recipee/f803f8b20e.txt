Crockpot Rotisserie Chicken


Ingredients


 - 5 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, paprika


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, onion powder


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Remove chicken from packaging and remove everything from the cavity. Rinse with water and place chicken in a lined crockpot. If you dont have liners, spray the crock liberally with nonstick cooking spray. Combine seasonings in a small bowl and stir to combine. I like to do this with my fingers. Apply seasoning to the chicken adding some inside the cavity and even adding some under the skin if youd like. Put the lid on the crockpot and cook on high 4-5 hours or on low for 8 hours or until the button pops out. * When you are getting it ready for serving and removing the meat from the bones, be careful as some of the bones are quite small and can splinter easily.

Homemade Dark Brown Sugar


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/4 cup of molasses


Instructions: 

In a blender or food processor add sugar and molasses. Pulse until it is JUST incorporated. This is the super fast way. By hand, just use the back of a fork to blend it all together. There you go. As simple as that. Now store in an airtight container. I use a two cup capacity container so it fills it up completely. As you use it, put it into smaller containers. This helps keep it from getting hard. Store in a cool, dry area. Technique shared by taylor68too.

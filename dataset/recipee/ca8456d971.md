### Ingredients

 - 14 ounce of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 4 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 13 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

### Instructions

Place the can of coconut milk in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Do not open or shake the can. Dont touch it! The next day: In a large mixing bowl add cream cheese and sugar; beat until combined. Add vanilla extract and beat until incorporated. This next step is very important. Spoon out the coconut cream from the top of the can of coconut milk and place it in the cream cheese mixture and beat until light and fluffy. NOTE: do not use the liquid from the can of coconut milk. You just want the solids from the can. You should have about a 1/2 cup of liquid coconut milk left over. Discard it or use for another purpose. Beat in cocoa powder, until light and fluffy. You may have to scrape down the sides of the bowl a few times. Taste to see if you need more sugar or cocoa powder. Evenly divide into 4 cups and serve! You can also top with fresh berries!

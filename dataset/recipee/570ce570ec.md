### Ingredients

 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 14 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 14 cup of lard

 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table

 - 4 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir in other ingredients, and enough flour to form a soft dough. Knead lightly for 5 or 6 minutes then form into a ball. Let dough rise till doubled, 40 - 60 minutes. Punch down dough and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll out to 1/2" thickness and cut with 1 1/2" biscuit cutter. Let biscuits rise for 15 - 20 minutes while frying oil/fat heats. Heat frying oil/fat to just over 350 degrees F. If fat is too hot, the biscuits will be soggy in the center. Drop biscuit into the hot fat, a few at a time. Fry for 1 or 2 minutes till golden on the bottom. Flip each biscuit over (if it doesn't flip by itself!) and fry until golden brown. Drain on absorbent paper. Cut a biscuit open to check for doneness, and adjust frying time if needed. Serve warm with lots of apple butter, to be authentic. These freeze well - just reheat wrapped in foil in a warm oven.

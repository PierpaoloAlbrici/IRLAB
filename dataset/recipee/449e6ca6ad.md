### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt

 - 3 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

 - 4 cup of blackberries, raw

 - 1 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 6 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 3/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Whisk 1 cup of flour with the salt in a mixing bowl. Mix in the softened butter until the mixture resembles cornmeal. Stir in the ice water until a dough forms. Refrigerate until ready to use. Place the berries in a mixing bowl, and sprinkle with 1 1/4 cups sugar and 6 tablespoons of flour. Stir in the water until moistened, and scrape into a 2-quart baking dish. Roll the dough on a floured work surface to 1/4-inch thick, and cut into 3/4-inch strips. Place onto the berries in a crisscross pattern. Scatter the diced butter over top. Bake in the preheated oven until the berries are tender and the crust is golden brown, about 30 minutes.

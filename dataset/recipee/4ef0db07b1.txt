Instructions: 

Pre heat oven to 350F Line an 8"x8"x2" pan with parchment paper. Lightly grease the parchment paper and the exposed pan or coat with a non-stick spray. Stir together all the dry ingredients, including the fruit and nuts. In a separate bowl, whisk together the vanilla, melted butter or margarine, liquid sweeteners, water, and nut butter until smooth. Toss the wet incredients witht eh dry until the mixture is evenly curmbly. Spread in the prepared pan, pressing them in firmly. Bake the bars for 28-35 minutes, until they're lightly browned on the edges. They will still sem soft and underbaked when you press the centre. Let cool fully before cutting in to squares with the serrated knife. I sometimes put them in the freezer befor cutting so the cut smoothly. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator or in the freezer. *My favorite add ins are dried cherries, chocolate chips, pecans and seasme seeds. However you can add dried cranberries, apricots, apples, pears, walnuts, pistachios, sunflower seeds, coconut, or any other dried fruit or nuts. I sometimes even add protien powder or dried greens.

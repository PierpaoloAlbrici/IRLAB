### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of nuts, cashew nuts, raw

 - 3 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 12 cup of seeds, sunflower seed kernels, dried

### Instructions

In a food processor grind cashews until finely minced. Drizzle oil through top spout of processor until desired creamy consistency is obtained; may need to add more oil. In a separate bowl, add sunflower seeds to cashew butter and mix well by hand. Store in refrigerator in a lidded glass jar for up to 2 weeks. Tip: if adding agave nectar or honey to nut butters, it will change the consistency and become dry and difficult to spread once refrigerated - add agave or honey as you use your nut butters to maintain a nice, spreadable consistency.

### Ingredients

 - 450 g of oats

 - 120 g of seeds, sunflower seed kernels, dried

 - 120 g of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

 - 175 ml of apple juice, canned or bottled, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

 - 120 g of syrup, maple, canadian

 - 4 tablespoon of honey

 - 100 g of sugars, brown

 - 250 g of nuts, almonds

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 300 g of raisins, seeded

### Instructions

Mix everything (except raisins) together very well in a large mixing bowl. I use a spatula as this mixture just sticks to your hands. Spread this mixture on two baking trays and bake at gas mark 3 / 170c for 40-60mins. Turn the mixture over half way baking to make sure that it is evenly golden and no one part gets to much of a toasting. Once baked allow to cool and mix together with the Raisins. Store in a airtight container.

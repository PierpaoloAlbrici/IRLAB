Butter Cookies With Raisins Recipe


Ingredients


 - 3/4 cup of butter, without salt


 - 2/3 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/2 cup of raisins, seeded


Instructions: 

Using electric mixer, beat butter, sugar and salt in large bowl till creamy. Fold in vanilla. Add in flour and raisins; mix till smooth dough forms. Divide dough in half. Shape each dough half into 1 1/2-inch-diameter log. Wrap each log in plastic; chill till hard, about 2 hrs. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled.) Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Butter 2 large baking sheets. Cut each dough log into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Place slices on prepared baking sheets, spacing 1 inch apart. Bake till cookies are golden brown, about 10 min. Cold slightly on baking sheets. Transfer to racks; cold completely. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Store in airtight container at room temperature.) This recipe yields about 3 dozen. Comments: In England, these crisp raisin-flecked treats are called Madeira biscuits - biscuit being the British word for cookie, and a glass of Madeira being a favorite accompaniment for this particular type.

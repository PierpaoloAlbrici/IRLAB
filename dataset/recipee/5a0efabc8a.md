### Ingredients

 - 12 pound of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw

 - 12 cup of spices, garlic powder

 - 14 cup of tomatoes, sun-dried

### Instructions

Spread each slice of roast beef with cream cheese. Sprinkle with chopped sundried tomatoes. Roll up each slice tightly. Refrigerate, covered, for at least an hour or until firm. To serve, cut each roll into 4 pieces. Secure each with a cocktail toothpick. NOTE: Cream cheese with chives may be substituted. Also, these rollups are not served on their sides like pinwheels. The cut sides are on each end, not up and down. They may be secured with sprigs of fresh rosemary, instead of the toothpick.

Blueberry Jam, Made in the Microwave


Ingredients


 - 200 g of blueberries, raw


 - 100 g of honey


Instructions: 

Put the washed blueberries and honey into a heatproof bowl and microwave for 3 minutes. Remove the scum and microwave 3 times (30 seconds each time), then you're done. It's runny, but it will harden when cooled. Pour the jam into a sterilized (washed and microwaved for 2 minutes) jar and let it chill. All done!

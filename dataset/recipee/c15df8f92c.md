 - 1 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, rosemary, dried

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325 F. 2. Spray a baking dish with vegetable oil (just enough to coat it). 3. Put your chicken on a plate (or cutting board). Put your rosemary salt and garlic powder on both sides of each chicken cutlet. 4. Put your black pepper on one side of each chicken cutlet. 5. Transfer each cutlet from the plate to the baking dish, pepper side up. 6. Put the dish in the oven and bake the chicken for 20 minutes. There is no need to flip these if you use the thin cutlets. 7. After the timer goes off, remove the dish from the oven and serve immediately.

### Ingredients

 - 1 pint of strawberries, raw

 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

Wash the strawberries and remove the green stems. Cut the strawberries and place them in a bowl. Toss them with the sugar and cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and even overnight. The sugar will draw moisture out of the berries and naturally make a sweet strawberry syrup.

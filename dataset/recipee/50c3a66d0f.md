### Ingredients

 - 3 1/2 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 2 tablespoon of cornstarch

### Instructions

Melt the chocolate in a saucepan over low heat, or in the microwave. When the chocolate has melted, add the corn starch and stir well. Be careful with the cornstarch, if you add too much you will get pudding! In another saucepan bring milk to a boil and pour in the chocolate mixture. Bring back to a boil for 2 minutes to make it thicken. Pour into cups. Serve it with whipping cream. Tip:. The better the quality of the chocolate you use, the better your hot chocolate will taste. You can use white, milk or dark chocolate for this recipe.

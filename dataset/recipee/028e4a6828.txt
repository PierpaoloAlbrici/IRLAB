Lemon Granita


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 3/4 cup of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

Pour the water and sugar into a small saucepan, and bring to a boil. Boil until the sugar is completely dissolved. Remove from heat, and stir in the lemon juice. Let cool slightly. Pour into twelve 8-ounce plastic or paper cups, and freeze overnight or until solid. For a granular ice another option is to put the lemon mixture in a wide ceramic baking pan and set it in the freezer, scraping and mixing it every half hour as it solidifies. When all the liquid has solidified into loose crystals it is ready to serve. Spoon into decorative glasses.

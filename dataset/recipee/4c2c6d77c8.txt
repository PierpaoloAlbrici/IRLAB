Broc Sauce


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular


 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Amounts are completely flexible. Taste as you go and adjust amounts as needed. Mix lemon juice into mayo and stir till smooth with a fork or small whisk. Stir in seasoning salt gradually till it tastes right. The tangy-ness of this sauce goes perfectly with broccoli. It would probably be good on other veggies too, like Brussels sprouts (little green balls of death! ).

### Ingredients

 - 1/2 ounce of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 8 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/4 cup of salt, table

 - 1 cup of lard

### Instructions

Begin by making an open fire oven with coals. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water and let stand for 5 minutes. In a separate large bowl, mix together the flour, salt, and lard. Knead thoroughly, and then add the yeast mixture and continue to knead until it has reached a dough consistency. Cover dough with a clean kitchen towel and set in a warm dark place to let rise for 45 minutes. Divide dough in half and knead again to remove any air pockets. Place each half in a separate aluminum pan and press the dough down. Push the coals and ashes of the fire to one side, but do not put fire out. Place the aluminum pans on the clean ground of the open fire oven, and bake for 45 minutes. Slice and serve with butter.

Egg-Free Miso & Sesame Okara Biscotti


Ingredients


 - 100 g of okara


 - 100 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 50 g of sugars, brown


 - 30 g of miso


 - 25 g of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried


 - 30 ml of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

In a plastic bag or a bowl, add all the * ingredients and mix well. Add the okara and mix well. Combine the miso, milk, and the sesame seeds, add to the Step 1 mixture, and mix well. Preheat the oven to 170C. Place the dough onto parchment paper and shape it into about a 12 x 25 cm oblong shape. It's easier to shape the dough with wet hands. Place on the top rack of the 170C oven and bake for about 20 minutes. Take it out of the oven, once the dough cools down a little, cut it into 1 cm slices while it's still warm, and place back on the baking tray. Lower the oven temperature to 160C, and bake both sides for 10 minutes each, 20 minutes total. Cool on the baking tray. Note: Since they get stale easily, store them in an airtight container. If they become stale, toast them and they will be crunchy again. This is the miso I used for this recipe. If you use Saikyo miso, it creates a mild and refined flavor. Choose the one to suits your taste.

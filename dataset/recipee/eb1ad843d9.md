### Ingredients

 - 2 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 5 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 2 tablespoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

### Instructions

Mix first 5 dough ingredients in a large bowl to make a sticky dough, or beat in a stand mixer for 3 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature overnight or for at least 8 hours; the dough will become bubbly and rise quite a bit, so make sure it's in a large bowl. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and form into a log or round loaf to fit a 14" to 15" lidded stonewar baker or 9" to 10" round lidded baking crock. Place dough in lightly greased pan, smooth-side up. Cover and let rise at room temperature for about 2 hours, until a slight indentation remains when you poke it with your finger. Just before baking, make several slashed to allow for expansion. Spritz or brush dough with water and sprinkle about 1 tablespoon topping. Place bread in cold oven and set temperature to 450. Bake bread for 50 minutes, then remove lid and continue to bake for another 5-10 minutes, until it's deep brown in color. Remove bread from oven, turn it onto a rack and cool before slicing.

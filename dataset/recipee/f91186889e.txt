Quick Delicious Oatmeal Bread


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of oats


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 4 tablespoon of honey


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grind oatmeal in a food processor or blender (optional! I usually grind about half of the oats! ). In a large bowl, combine oatmeal, flour, baking powder and salt. In a separate bowl, dissolve honey in vegetable oil then stir in the milk. Combine both mixtures and stir until a soft dough is formed. Form the dough into a ball (it will be very sticky) and place on a lightly oiled baking sheet. I usually sprinkle semolina/coarse corn meal on baking sheet for added crunch and so loaf doesn't stick to pan. Bake in preheated oven for about 20-30 minutes, or until bottom of loaf sounds hollow when tapped.

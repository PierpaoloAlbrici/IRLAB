Instructions: 

Coat a 13"x9" baking pan with nonstick cooking spray. Combine cereal, pretzels, peanuts and caramels in large bowl. Microwave morsels in medium, uncovered, microwave-safe bowl on MEDIUM-HIGH(70%) power for 1 minute; stir. Morsels may retain some of their original shape. If necessary, microwave at additional 10-15 second intervals, stirring just until morsels are melted. Pour over cereal mixture; stir to coat evenly. Spread mixture in prepared baking pan; cool for 30-45 minutes or until firm. Break into bite-size pieces. Serve and enjoy!

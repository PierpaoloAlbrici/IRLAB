### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of soup, swanson chicken broth 99% fat free

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

### Instructions

Place the chicken fat and salt in a small, heavy saucepan. Cook very slowly over low heat, stirring from time to time, until the fat is completely liquified and the cracklings are golden brown. Strain the fat into a jar or crock and refrigerate. Reserve the cracklings - crisp, fried bits that are left after fat is rendered - to use in making chopped liver or as a garnish for salads or mashed potatoes.

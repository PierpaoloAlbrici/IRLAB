Basic Shortbread With Mrs. Kostyra Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1 1/3 cup of butter, without salt


 - 2/3 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 3/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 3/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 3 1/3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


Instructions: 

Heat oven to 275 degrees. Butter a 9- by 13- by 1-inch baking pan, and line bottom with parchment paper. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream butter and sugar on medium speed till light and fluffy, about 2 min. Add in salt and vanilla, and beat to combine. Add in flour, 1 c. at a time, beating on low speed till just combined. Press dough into prepared pan, leveling and smoothing the top. Using a dough scraper or possibly the back of a knife, cut dough lengthwise into nine strips slightly less than 1-inch wide. Cut the strips crosswise into thirty-six 3-inch bars. Using the tines of a fork or possibly a wooden skewer, create a decorative pattern on the surface. Bake shortbread till proportionately pale golden brown, but not browned, 70 to 85 min. Transfer pan to a wire rack to cold. Invert pan, and remove parchment. Turn shortbread over, and carefully break, or possibly cut with a serrated knife, into bars. Store in an airtight container up to 1 month. This recipe yields 36 bars. Yield: 3 dozen

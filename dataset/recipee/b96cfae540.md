### Ingredients

 - 7 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt

 - 34 cup of cranberries, dried, sweetened

 - 34 cup of raisins, seeded

 - 34 cup of seeds, sunflower seed kernels, dried

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 34 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

 - 34 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Mix the cereal, fruit, nuts or seeds, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Put rice syrup (honey will work too), almond butter (or any other nut butter), and butter in a saucepan and slowly heat up until everything is melted together smoothly. Alternately, you can place the rice syrup and butters in a microwave safe bowl and melt them in the microwave. Pour the syrup over the cereal mixture and mix well. Wet hands with water and press the cereal into a pan (the recipe called for a 9x9 pan, but I'd added so many goodies that I used a 9x12 and it was FULL). Let cool. Cut into 15 bars. Store in refridgerator.

Passion Fruit Caramel Sauce


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 teaspoon of syrups, corn, light


 - 1/4 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 1/3 cup of passion-fruit juice, yellow, raw


Instructions: 

Combine sugar, 1/2 cup water, and corn syrup in heavy large saucepan. Stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves, occasionally brushing down sides of pan with wet pastry brush. Increase heat and boil without stirring until syrup turns medium amber color, swirling pan occasionally, about 8 minutes. Remove pan from heat. Whisk in butter, then passion fruit concentrate (mixture will bubble up). Simmer over medium-low heat until color deepens to rich brown and caramel thickens enough to coat spoon thickly, stirring occasionally, about 12 minutes. Transfer sauce to bowl. (Can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill. Rewarm slightly before serving.)

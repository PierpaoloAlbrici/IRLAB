### Ingredients

 - 6 pound of apples, raw, with skin

 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of honey

### Instructions

Wash, core and chop apples. I usually prepare a bowl of cold water and toss the chopped apples in there until I am done preparing them - they brown less that way! Preheat oven to 375F. Place apples (drained) in a dutch oven. Add honey and lemon juice. Toss to coat. Bake, covered, for 30 minutes. Stir and return to oven, uncovered. Bake another 30 minutes, stirring half-way through. Mash slightly with spoon. NOTE: If sauce it too liquid to your taste, prolong baking.

Instructions: 

Preheat you oven to 140 degrees C. Butter a 20 x 20cm pan and line with baking paper, leaving a few centimetres of overhang. This will make for easy removal. Put the oats, almonds, coconut, wheat germ, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, apricots and cranberries into a bowl and toss together to combine. Place the remaining ingredients into a saucepan and place over a medium heat. Slowly bring to a boil, stirring until butter has melted and sugar has dissolved. Pour the wet mixture over the dry ingredients and stir together. Dump the mix into your prepared pan and press down evenly. Bake for about 30 minutes or until light golden brown. Leave to cool in the pan before cutting.

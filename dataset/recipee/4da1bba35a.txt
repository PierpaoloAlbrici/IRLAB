Buttered Rum Meltaways


Ingredients


 - 1 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 tablespoon of cornstarch


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, cloves, ground


 - 3/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 3/4 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of sugars, powdered


 - 1/4 cup of alcoholic beverage, distilled, rum, 80 proof


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Whisk together flour, cornstarch, spices, and salt in a bowl. Put butter and 1/3 cup confectioners sugar into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium speed until pale and fluffy. Mix in rum and vanilla. Reduce speed to low, and gradually mix in flour mixture. Divide dough in half. Place each on a piece of parchment paper; shape dough into logs. Fold parchment over dough; using a ruler, roll and press into a 1 1/4-inch-thick log. Wrap in parchment. Chill in freezer at least 30 minutes or up to 1 month. Preheat oven to 350F. Remove parchment. Cut logs into 1/4-inch-thick rounds; space 1 inch apart on parchment paperlined baking sheets. Bake until just golden, about 15 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire racks; let cool 10 minutes. Gently toss warm cookies with remaining 2/3 cup confectioners sugar in a resealable plastic bag. Cookies can be stored in airtight containers at room temperature up to 2 weeks.

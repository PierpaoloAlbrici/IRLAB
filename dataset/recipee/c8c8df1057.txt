Gingersnap Date Bar (Larabar Wannabe)


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of dates, deglet noor


 - 12 pound of nuts, almonds


 - 1 1/4 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, cloves, ground


Instructions: 

Using a food mill, grind the dates. In a heavy-duty mixer, combine the ground dates with the remaining ingredients (I used my Bosch and its "cookie dough" hooks). On a cutting board or other clean, flat surface, flatten the mixture to about 1 cm using your hand or a rolling pin. Cut into bars or roll into balls and enjoy!

Flatbread With Grapes


Ingredients


 - 18 ounce of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 34 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 2 pound of grapes, red or green (european type, such as thompson seedless), raw


Instructions: 

Place the flour in the bowl of a food processor. Add the yeast, salt, and 1/2 cup of the sugar; process to blend. With the motor running, add enough warm water to make a soft dough; add 1/4 cup of the olive oil, and process for 45 seconds. Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover, and allow it to rise in a warm place until doubled, about 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 375F. Oil a rectangular baking sheet. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work counter. Using a rolling pin, roll it out in to a rectangle 1/8" thick. Line the baking sheet with the dough (half of it should hang over). Spread half of the grapes over it, drizzle with 1/4 cup of the olive oil, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup of the sugar. Bring the overhanging dough up over the grapes, covering them completely; press lightly to seal. Scatter the remaining grapes over the dough; press to make sure they don't roll off. Drizzle with the remaining olive oil and sprinkle with the remaining sugar. Let rest for 45 minutes. Bake the schiacciata until the dough is golden brown and the grapes are soft and syrupy, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Serve hot or at room temperature. A dusting of confectioner's sugar is a nice touch.

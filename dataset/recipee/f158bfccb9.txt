Cured Char with Gin


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of fish, salmon, atlantic, wild, raw


 - 1/3 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1/3 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/3 cup of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of corn, sweet, white, raw


 - 3 tablespoon of alcoholic beverage, distilled, gin, 90 proof


 - 1/2 cup of dill weed, fresh


Instructions: 

If you have 1 fillet, cut it into 2 equal pieces. If you have 2 fillets, they should be of equal size. In a small bowl, mix together the sugars, salt, peppercorns, and gin to form a paste. Divide the paste evenly among the 4 sides of the fish pieces. Using half of the dill, cover the flesh side of both pieces, and then join the sides together. Slip the sandwiched pieces into a lock-top plastic bag, press out the air, and seal closed. Place the bag between 2 plates, place the setup in the fridge, and leave for 8 hours. Remove the fish from the bag, rinse well under cool water, and pat dry. Cover with the remaining dill, slip the fish into a new bag, and refrigerate again for at least 8 or up to 10 hours so the cure can even out. Remove the fish from the bag, slice thinly, and serve.

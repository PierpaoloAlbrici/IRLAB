### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 23 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 13 cup of jams and preserves, apricot

 - 1 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 1 tablespoon of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

### Instructions

Cream butter and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract until light and fluffy, then stir in sugar and whip until smooth. Slowly stir in flour and mix until blended. Roll dough into one inch balls and place a deep/narrow indentation in the center of each cookie. Fill center of each cookie with raspberry jam. ( I like to put mine in a Ziploc baggie and cut off the tip to do this. Much easier this way!) Refrigerate cookies 1 hour. Place cookies 2 inches apart on greased cookie sheet. Bake 9 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit and allow cookies to cool on wire rack. Mix powdered sugar with 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and half & half to form glaze. Pipe glaze onto cooled cookies!

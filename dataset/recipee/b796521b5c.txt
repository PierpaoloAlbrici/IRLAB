Pretty Honey Butter


Ingredients


 - 13 cup of honey


 - 13 cup of butter, without salt


 - 13 cup of jams and preserves, apricot


Instructions: 

With an electric mixer mix honey, butter and any kind of jam you wish. If scooped with an ice-cream scoop this looks like pretty ice-cream. If we are having company, I like to make a couple of different colors of honey butter.

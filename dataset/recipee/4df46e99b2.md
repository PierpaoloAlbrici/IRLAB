### Instructions

Line cookie sheet with wax paper or foil. Glad Press and Seal on a table or a counter works great too. Measure oats, peanut butter, vanilla, peanuts (if using) and set aside. Combine sugar, butter, milk and cocoa in medium sauce pan. Cook over MEDIUM heat, STIRRING CONSTANTLY, until mixture comes to a rolling boil. *** (DO NOT OVER BOIL. If you are not sure, remove from the heat once it reaches a boil). Remove from heat. Add oats, peanut butter, peanuts (if using) and vanilla; stir quickly; mix well. Immediately drop mixture by heaping teaspoonfuls onto prepared surface. Cool. Store in cool dry place. Make sure you lick the bowl/spoon and enjoy! Personal Tips:. *I use the Reduce Fat Jiff Peanut Butter and it works great. *I add up to 1 1/2 tsp additional of vanilla. *I always use butter. *Any % of milk will work, I normally use skim or 2%, it doesnt make a difference.

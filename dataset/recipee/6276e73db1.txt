Homemade Buttermilk


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

*Note: You can half the recipe easily (1 cup milk to 1 tablespoon acidic ingredient). An ideal acidic ingredient (if you have on hand, in pantry) is cream of tartar. If you have cream of tartar on hand, use for 1 cup of milk, 1 1/2 tablespoons of cream of tartar. Double if recipe calls for it (2 cups milk to 3 tablespoons cream of tartar). I use vinegar, and it works great!! Cream of tartar is hard to find where I live. 1. Heat milk in microwave for 30 seconds. 2. Add vinegar or lemon juice and let stand at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes. The milk will begin to curdle a bit. 3. Use in any recipe that calls for buttermilk! !

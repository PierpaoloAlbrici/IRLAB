Simple Double Pie Crust


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 34 cup of shortening, vegetable, household, composite


 - 14 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Sift flour before measuring; spoon lightly into measuring cup and level without shaking or packing down. Combine flour and salt. With a pastry blender or two knives, cut in vegetable shortening until uniform; mixture should be fairly coarse. Sprinkle with water, a tablespoon at a time; toss with a fork. Work dough into a firm ball with your hands; divide dough into two parts and press into flat circles with smooth edges. On a lightly floured surface, roll bottom crust to a circle about 1 1/2" larger than inverted pie plate. Gently ease dough into pie plate; trim edge even with plate and add filling. Moisten rim of bottom crust with water. Roll top crust the same way and lift onto filled pie; trim 1/2" beyond the edge of pie plate. Fold top edge under bottom crust and flute with fingers or fork. Prick or slit top crust to allow for escape of steam; bake according to time and temperature recommended for filling used.

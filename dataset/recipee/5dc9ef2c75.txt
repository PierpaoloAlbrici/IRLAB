Easy, Healthy and Delicious Raspberry Muffins (Easily Vegan)


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 tablespoon of sweetener, herbal extract powder from stevia leaf


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 12 cup of applesauce, canned, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid (includes usda commodity)


 - 12 cup of beverages, almond milk, unsweetened, shelf stable


 - 14 cup of butter, without salt


 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 2 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 1 pint of raspberries, raw


Instructions: 

1. Heat your oven to 350 Degrees. 2. Combine dry and wet ingredients 3. Mix until moist and fully combined (Sometimes the butter is hard to mix in so make sure it's mixed in fully before baking). 4. Use a non stick cooking spray or line your pan with baking cups. 5. Fill each cup to about 3/4 full. 6. Put in oven for about 40 minutes (I know it might seem like a long time, but time varies for different ovens and mine is older so it took a little longer). 7. When muffins have cooked fully or have gotten a nice golden brown top, pull from the oven an let it sit on a cool surface for 5-10 minutes. 8. Enjoy! A good tip is to top the muffins with a little sugar (regular or brown in the later stages of baking to add a nice crust) These also taste good with a little cream cheese. Note: Don't be surprised if these don't rise too high.

[22dec88681](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/edamame-cooked-fresh-soybeans-recipe.html)

### Ingredients

 - 1/2 pound of margarine, regular, hard, soybean (hydrogenated)

 - 2 tablespoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Separate the pods from the stalks. Place bean pods in a large bowl. Sprinkle generously with salt, rub vigorously, and let stand 15 minutes. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil, add the beans and boil over high heat for 5 to 6 minutes. (For a firmer bean, decrease the cooking time.) Don't cover the pot or the beans will lose their bright green color. When ready, drain beans and serve hot or at room temperature. To eat as finger food, serve the beans in baskets or bowls. Squeeze the pods with your fingers to press the beans into your mouth and discard the pods.

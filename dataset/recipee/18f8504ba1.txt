Roasted Gemstone Potatoes


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, rosemary, dried


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Spray a 13 x 9 dish with nonstick spray. Halve or chop the potatoes in thirds so they are roughly the same size and place in the baking dish. Drizzle with olive oil and season with the salt, pepper, and rosemary. Toss to coat. Bake for 1 hour or until slightly crispy yet tender. Leave in a little longer if you like your potatoes very crispy. Makes 6-8 servings. Enjoy!

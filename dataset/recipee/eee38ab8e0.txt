Sliced Potatoes with Bacon and Parsley


Ingredients


 - 4 pound of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 12 cup of vinegar, cider


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 pound of bacon, meatless


 - 1 cup of onions, raw


 - 2 cup of soup, beef broth or bouillon canned, ready-to-serve


 - 12 cup of parsley, fresh


Instructions: 

Peel potatoes and place in a large pot with enough water to cover by several inches. Bring to a boil over high heat, add 1 tablespoon salt and reduce to a gentle boil. Cook until potatoes are just tender when pierced with a knife. Do not overcook. While the potatoes cook, combine the vinegar, sugar and remaining salt in a small saucepan and place over medium heat until sugar is dissolved, then pour over potatoes. Saute bacon in a large skillet placed over medium-low heat, stirring frequently until browned and crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Drain excess fat from skillet, leaving a thin coat of bacon grease in skillet. Saute onions until translucent but not browned. Pour in the beef broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until reduced by half; about 20 minutes. Pour the broth mixture over the reserved warm potato mixture and sprinkle with the reserved bacon and chopped parsley. Gently stir to combine and serve immediately.

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 3 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 tablespoon of sweetener, syrup, agave

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

### Instructions

Discard soaking water and rinse cashews thoroughly until water runs clear. Place cashews, fresh water, agave and salt in a Vitamix or other high-powered blender. Process on high speed for 20-30 seconds. Store in a glass mason jar in the refrigerator. Notes: 1. This cashew milk has the viscosity of regular whole milk; if you want to make milk with the consistency of 2% cow milk, add another cup of water. For half-and-half (great for coffee and tea), use only 2 cups water in the above recipe. 2. Cashew milk is very foamy when first removed from the Vitamix; it settles nicely after sitting in the fridge overnight. Often a layer of cream forms on top of the milk, but dont be thrown, underneath is pure, delicious white stuff.

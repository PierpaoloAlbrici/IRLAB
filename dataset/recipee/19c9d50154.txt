Halloween Leftovers - Roasted Pumpkin Seeds!


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of seeds, pumpkin and squash seeds, whole, roasted, without salt


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 dash of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 170C Place pumpkin seeds in a pan of salted water and boil the pumpkin seeds for 10 minutes. This helps the salty flavour penetrate the seed, rather than just being salty on the outside :) Drizzle olive oil onto an oven tray large enough to accomodate your seeds Drain the pumpkin seeds well, drying them on a paper towel to absorb excess moisture Pour the seeds onto the oven tray, shaking them around to distribute the olive oil onto the seeds Roast the seeds for 10 minutes (maybe less, dependent on size), then turn them over and roast for a further 10 minutes Remove from oven and serve hot or cold. They taste a bit like salted pistachios, with a similarly satisfying crunch :) nice as a side dish or just to snack on.

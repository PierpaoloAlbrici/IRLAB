Tomato Soup - Quick and Easy


Ingredients


 - 2 quart of tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average


 - 2 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 3 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, onion powder


Instructions: 

Pour Juice into crock pot or pot. Mix the flour into the milk until smooth and dissolved (I usually put them into a small canning jar, put the lid on and shake it like a crazy woman until it's smooth!) :). Pour the flour/milk mixture into juice and add the rest of the spices. Crockpot: Cook on low for about 3 hours or more. Stove top: Cook on Meduim/High until it boils. Turn it to Medium/Low and let simmer for about 20 minutes until the flavors have developed and it has gotten a little thicker. Add more spices to your taste and enjoy!

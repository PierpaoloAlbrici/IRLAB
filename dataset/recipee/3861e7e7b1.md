[3861e7e7b1](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/drinks/hot-buttered-rum-mix/)

### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of butter, without salt

 - 1 pound of sugars, powdered

 - 1 pound of sugars, brown

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1 quart of ice creams, vanilla

### Instructions

To make mix, cream butter and sugars together in mixer until fully incorporated. Add nutmeg and cinnamon. Gradually incorporate softened ice cream into mixture. Continue to mix for about 5 minutes to ensure that all ingredients are fully mixed. Separate into containers and store in the freezer. This makes quite a bit of mix. We use the smaller round Ziploc containers and take one to each of the neighbors and family. To prepare drink, add a heaping spoonful (or more, to taste) to one cup of boiling water and 1 shot of good dark rum. Top with a shake of nutmeg and a cinnamon stick.

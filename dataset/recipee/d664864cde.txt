Easy Haupia


Ingredients


 - 5 tablespoon of cornstarch


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/8 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Place the cornstarch, sugar, and salt into a saucepan; stir in 1/4 of the coconut milk to make a smooth paste. Stir in the remaining coconut milk, and bring to a simmer over low heat, stirring constantly. Cook and stir until thickened so that it coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Pour into a 9x13 inch baking dish; refrigerate until cold.

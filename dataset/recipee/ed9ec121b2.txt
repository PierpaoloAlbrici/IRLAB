Flour Tortillas


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 13 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Place all ingredients into a large bowl (or use a dough hook attachment on a stand mixer) and knead until well mixed and smooth. Divide dough into 16 equal size balls. Flatten slightly with the palm of your hand and let rest on a floured board for 15 minutes. Heat a large frying pan to medium heat. Roll out tortillas into 6 inch circles. Once the pan is hot enough, cook the tortillas one at a time until pale brown bubbles show on the bottom (30 seconds to 1 minute). To turn these into chips, brush each tortilla with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt and bake at 450 degrees for 5 minutes. To turn these into individual thin crust pizzas, put toppings on tortilla and bake at 450 degrees for 4-5 minutes.

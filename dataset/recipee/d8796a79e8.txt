Almond Bark Popcorn


Ingredients


 - 16 cup of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)


 - 3 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 2 cup of oil, corn, peanut, and olive


 - 1 1/2 pound of nuts, almonds


 - 3 tablespoon of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


Instructions: 

Melt the peanut butter and almond bark together in the microwave or on low on the stove. Dump the popped popcorn, peanuts, rice krispies and peanuts together in a large bowl. Pour the almond bark/peanut butter mixture over and mix well. Lay out on a grease cookie sheet. Let harden. Put in zip lock bags. I'm guessing on servings; I'd say 16-20.

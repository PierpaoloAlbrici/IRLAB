Butter cookies


Ingredients


 - 115 g of butter, without salt


 - 1/3 cup of sugars, powdered


 - 2/3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of cornstarch


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 185a. Add softened butter and sifted sugar and mix until pale. Sift in flour and cornstarch and mix until everything is combined. Knead vigorously and place on a floured surface. Cut in half, roll each into small strips and cut them into 20 pieces each. Press them into balls with your hands (don't roll them or they'll fall apart!) Press each one lightly with a fork and shape the sides so they are super neat! Bake for about 15 minutes or until the biscuits start to brown. Let cool and then you're done!

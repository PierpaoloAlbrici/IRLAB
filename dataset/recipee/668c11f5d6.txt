Marinated BBQ Flank Steak


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of beef, flank, steak, separable lean and fat, trimmed to 0" fat, all grades, cooked, broiled


 - 1/4 cup of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw


Instructions: 

Place flank steak in a large baggie (I used a freezer bag) and pound it to about 1/2 thick. Place marinade over steak and be sure that the steak is completely covered. Place in refrigerator and marinate for 1 hour or overnight. Heat grill to medium heat. Place flank steak on grill, discarding leftover marinade. Cook steak for about 5 minutes per side. Dont overcook the flank steak or it can become tough. Cover the flank steak with aluminum foil and let it rest for 10 minutes. Thinly cut the steak against the grain. Eat plain, or add to tacos, and or top with BBQ sauce.

 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched


 - 12 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9 x 13 pan. With an electric mixer, beat mayonnaise and sugar together. In a medium bowl, stir together flour, cocoa powder and baking soda. Add half of the flour mixture to the mayonnaise mixture. Add half of the buttermilk to the batter, beating well. Add remaining flour mixture and remaining buttermilk. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake 25 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted 2 inches from the edge comes out with crumbs attached. Let cool. Meanwhile, prepare ganache: Put chopped chocolate in a heat-resistant dish. Heat heavy cream over medium heat just until bubbles begin to form around the edges. Pour over chopped chocolate. Stir until smooth. Cut cake into pieces and pour ganache over each piece, so it drizzles down the sides. Garnish with chopped walnuts.

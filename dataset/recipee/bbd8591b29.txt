Parmesan Sunflower Yums


Ingredients


 - 5 ounce of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 13 cup of cheese, cheddar


 - 1 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2-3 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 14 cup of seeds, sunflower seed kernels, dried


Instructions: 

Pre heat oven to 350 and 2 line cookie sheets with baking paper. Beat butter until light and creamy, add 3/4 cup of parmesan and all cheddar, continue beating until combined. Fold in sifted flour, lemon pepper and sunflower seeds with a metal spoon or fork then get your floured hands in there and work it into a ball. Place on floured bench or board and knead for a few minutes until it feels smooth. Roll out to about 1/4 inch thick, cut into 1 and 1/2 inch squares and place on cookie sheets allowing room for spreading (about 15 per sheet). Sprinkle with remaining parmesan and bake for 10 to 15 minutes (watch 'em toward the end; they should be golden). Let cool on sheets before lifting off with spatula.

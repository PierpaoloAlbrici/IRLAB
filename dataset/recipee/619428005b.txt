Mango Butter


Ingredients


 - 8 cup of mango nectar, canned


 - 3 cup of sugars, brown


 - 3 tablespoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 1 teaspoon of lime juice, raw


 - 12 cup of lime juice, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


Instructions: 

Place mangoes in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until mangoes are very soft. (Since mangoes are usually very juicy, you needn't add any water unless the mixture starts to stick; then add up to 1/2 cup, a little at a time, as necessary.) When the mangoes are cooked, remove from heat; puree in a blender or food processor, working carefully in batches. Return puree to pan. Add sugar, ginger, lime zest, lime juice and cinnamon; mix well. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then lower heat and cook, stirring frequently, until very thick, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat; immediately pour into hot, sterilized jars, leaving 1/4-inch head space. Cap and process in a 10-minute boiling water bath.

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 3 tablespoon of dill weed, fresh

 - 1 1/4 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Into a bowl, sift together the flour, the baking powder, and the salt. Add the dill and 1 1/4 cups of the cream. Stir the mixture until it just forms a dough and gather the dough into a ball. On a lightly floured surface knead the dough gently 6 times and pat it out 1/2 inch thick. Cut out as many rounds as possible with a 3-inch round cutter dipped in flour and invert the rounds onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Gather the scraps, pat out the dough, and cut out more rounds in the same manner until there are 8 rounds in all. Brush the tops of the rounds with the additional cream, bake the biscuits in the middle of the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they are pale golden, and transfer them to a rack. Serve the biscuits at room temperature.

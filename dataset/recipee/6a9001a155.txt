Molasses Taffy Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1 1/3 cup of milk, canned, condensed, sweetened


 - 1/2 cup of molasses


 - 1/8 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Mix lowfat milk, molasses, and salt in heavy shallow saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly to 250 degrees or possibly till a little mix dropped in cool water forms a ball (approximately 35 min). Pour into 8x8x2-inch buttered pan or possibly platter. Let stand till cold sufficient to handle with hands. Butter hands and pull till hard (it will change color). Stretch into long rope cutting into inch-long pcs with scissors. (If pulled longer, you can break into candy sticks. It is better the longer you pull it.)

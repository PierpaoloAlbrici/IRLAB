### Ingredients

 - 1 1/4 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of spices, paprika

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, paprika

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, thyme, dried

### Instructions

Mix all ingredients together. Use as a rub on your approx 12-lb prepared salmon half. Note: Gene rubbed the salmon with the above and baked it with a drizzle of olive oil in one of those handy baking-bags and it was moist and delicious! Note 2: he mentioned that he used "regular" paprika because he was out of smoked paprika - I would've used sweet Hungarian and smoked Spanish, myself.

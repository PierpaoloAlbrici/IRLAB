### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 3 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat

 - 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

### Instructions

Place sugar in a food processor or blender to get the sugar super fine. Transfer to a bowl with yogurt, vanilla and lemon juice. Whisk until combined. Refrigerate mixture for at least 2 hours or overnight. Once chilled, place in an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturers instructions. Mine took about 15 minutes to freeze. Serve immediately or place in the freeze until ready to serve. If you are taking it out of the freezer, leave at room temperature for 15 minutes so it is easier to scoop.

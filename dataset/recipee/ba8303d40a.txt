Honey Wheat Bread With Zoom


Ingredients


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


 - 1 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 34 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt


 - 14 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 1/2-3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


Instructions: 

Blend oil, honey and warm water in large mixing bowl. Sprinkle with yeast and let stand 3 minutes. Stir in Krusteaz Zoom Cereal, whole wheat flour and salt. Add 1/4 cups all-purpose flour and salt. Stir vigorously 1 minute. Add enough remaining flour to make an easy to handle dough. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface 12-15 minutes or until smooth and elastic, but not sticky. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning to lightly coat all sides. Cover with a cloth. Let rise in a warm, draft-free place until double in size (about 1 hour). Punch dough down. Shape dough into a loaf and place in a greased 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. Cover with a cloth and let rise again until double in size (about 45 minutes). Bake at 375 degrees F 35-45 minutes or until ground brown and loaf sounds hollow when lightly tapped. Remove bread from pan to wire rack; cool. BREAD MACHINE INSTRUCTIONS. (For a 1 1/2 - 2 lb loaf capacity machine). Place all ingredients in bread pan, adding yeast last. (Some machines may require a yeast adjustment.) Select regular or whole wheat cycle. After the baking cycle ends, remove bread from pan to wire rack; cool.

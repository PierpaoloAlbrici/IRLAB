### Ingredients

 - 1 1/2 cup of oats

 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of sugars, brown

 - 14 cup of nuts, walnuts, english

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 34 cup of butter, salted

 - 12 ounce of jams and preserves, apricot

### Instructions

Combine all the dry ingredients. I like to give a couple pulses in my food processor to be sure it's blended well. Pour 1/2 of the dry mixture into a prepared 8X8 baking pan. Place thin pads of butter over the entire surface of the dry mixture. No overlapping is necessary, there can be some space between the pads. Spoon and spread the preservatives over the butter. Top with the remaining half of the dry mixture and then place more pads of butter on the top of that mixture. Bake at 350 for 30-40 minutes, or until golden brown. Let cool completely before cutting to avoid the bars falling apart.

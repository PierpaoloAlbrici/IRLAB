Roasted Parsnips and Carrots with a Touch of Thyme


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of parsnips, raw


 - 3/4 pound of carrots, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 3/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, thyme, dried


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Cut parsnips and carrots diagonally into pieces about the same size so they will cook evenly. Dont make them too small. Place in a Ziploc bag and add the olive oil, salt and pepper and mix well. Spread on rimmed cookie sheet and roast for 20 minutes, then test. They should be fork-tender. Sprinkle fresh thyme (or your favorite herb) and salt and pepper and serve hot. You could even cut them like French fries and surprise your family! They may not know the difference.

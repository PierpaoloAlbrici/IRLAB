### Ingredients

 - 1 pint of blackberries, raw

 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 1 quart of ice creams, vanilla

### Instructions

Combine the blackberries, sugar and lemon juice in a nonreactive bowl. Let the berries macerate, covered, at room temperature until the juices have run, about 1 hour. Gently mash berries with a spoon. Place the softened ice cream in a large bowl and fold in the berry mixture. *If you prefer, you could just drizzle the sauce on top of individual servings of ice cream*.

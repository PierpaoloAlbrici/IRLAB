Brown Rice and Broccoli Base Casserole


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 1 cup of broccoli, raw


 - 13 cup of onions, raw


 - 12 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 12 cup of soup, vegetable broth, ready to serve


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Lightly saute onions in olive oil over medium heat. Not trying to brown them, just don't want them raw going into the oven. Add rice, broccoli and cooked onions to a small casserole dish and mix. Pour vegetable broth into the saute pan used for onions and add salt. Stir while heating over medium heat. When bubbles appear, pour over casserole mix and stir. Cover the dish with foil or a lid and bake at 375 degrees in center of the oven for 30 mins (or until broccoli is tender and mix is bubbling).

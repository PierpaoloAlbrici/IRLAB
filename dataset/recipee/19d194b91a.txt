Stir-Fried Asparagus and Sesame Seeds (Weight Watchers)


Ingredients


 - 14 cup of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry


 - 12 teaspoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 1 teaspoon of cornstarch


 - 2 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 12 cup of onions, spring or scallions (includes tops and bulb), raw


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 5 1/2 cup of asparagus, raw


 - 2 teaspoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried


 - 2 teaspoon of oil, sesame, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

In a small bowl, blend the chicken broth and soy sauce with the corn starch. In a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat, warm the oil until hot but not smoking. Add the scallions, ginger, and garlic, and stir-fry until fragrant or about 30 seconds. Add the asparagus and stir-fry until the asparagus turns bright green, about 1 minute. Add the broth mixture and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring, until the sauce has thickened. Cover and steam over medium-high heat until the asparagus is crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small skillet, stir the sesame seeds over medium heat until toasted (I put mine in the microwave for a minute instead). This will take 2 to 4 minutes on the stove. Add the sesame oil to the asparagus and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Sprinkle the asparagus with the sesame seeds and serve.

### Ingredients

 - 250 g of nuts, chestnuts, european, dried, peeled

 - 50 g of sugars, granulated

 - 3 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Boil the fresh chestnuts for 30-40 minutes. Cut in half with a knife and remove with a spoon. You can do so if you'd like, but I prefer not to mash it smooth with the back of the spoon or a masher. Put sugar and water in a pot and simmer until slightly reduced. Cool to the touch. Add Steps 1 to 3, but don't do so all at once. Mix with a wooden spatula while checking how much you put in. This is while mid-mixing. It's just right when you can see the bottom of the pot. Portion into bite sized pieces and squeeze together firmly with a clean cloth. Gently wrap in 15x15cm plastic wrap and store.

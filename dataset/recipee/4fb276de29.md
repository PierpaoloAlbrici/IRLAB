### Ingredients

 - 6 ounce of candies, semisweet chocolate

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 12 ounce of tofu, raw, regular, prepared with calcium sulfate

 - 1/4 cup of syrup, maple, canadian

 - 1/4 cup of soymilk, original and vanilla, unfortified

 - 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 tablespoon of seeds, sesame butter, tahini, from roasted and toasted kernels (most common type)

 - 1/2 pint of strawberries, raw

### Instructions

Heat chocolate and oil in top of double boiler set over barely simmering water. Whisk until smooth. Remove pan from water, and let cool 20 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, cut tofu into thick slabs, and place on triple layer of paper towels. Press firmly on tofu to squeeze out as much water as possible; change paper towels if necessary. Put maple syrup, soymilk, lemon juice, vanilla extract and tahini into food processor. Crumble tofu into mixture, and puree until smooth, scraping down sides with spatula as necessary. Add melted chocolate, and process until well blended. Transfer pudding into 6 custard cups or small bowls. Cover each with plastic wrap, and refrigerate 2 to 3 hours, or until softly set. To serve, top with berries.

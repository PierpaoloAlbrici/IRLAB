### Ingredients

 - 2 pound of broccoli, raw

 - 12 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1 tablespoon of lime juice, raw

 - 34 cup of nuts, pecans

 - 34 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Put the broccoli florets in a large bowl. Pour the olive oil, salt and pepper in, and mix well, til the florets are lightly coated with oil and you can taste a little bit of the salt and pepper on the florets. You might need to adjust quantities to taste. Then, spread the florets evenly on a large baking sheet. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the broccoli are partly browned and the outsides are slightly crispy. Meanwhile, toast the pecans in a toaster oven for 5-10 min on the toast setting. When the broccoli is ready, take it out and let it cool 5 minutes, and then toss it with the toasted pecans, the parmesan cheese, the lime juice, and a little drizzle more of the olive oil. Toss and serve warm.

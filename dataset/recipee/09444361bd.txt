Man Salmon


Ingredients


 - 2 pound of fish, salmon, atlantic, wild, raw


 - 5 tablespoon of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 cup of sugars, brown


Instructions: 

Take a skin on salmon filet and smear it thickly with mayonaise all over. Sprinkle with brown sugar and pepper. Roast in a 425F oven for 15 minutes or so, depending on the thickness of the fish. The general rule is 10 minutes per inch of thickness. If the crust didnt brown, briefly broil until you get a crisp (a la creme brulee) crust.

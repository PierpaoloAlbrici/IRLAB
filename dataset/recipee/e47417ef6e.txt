Butter Ghee


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 12 cup of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


Instructions: 

Combine margarine and butter in a pot and let simmer, until it is transparent. *Mustcarefully pay attention to this while on stove, so that it doesnt scorch*. Let cool. You may want to pour through a cheesecloth, although my friend doesnt. Store in a clean container.

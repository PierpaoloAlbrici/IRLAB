Quick and Easy Cookies with 3 ingredients


Ingredients


 - 100 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched


 - 50 g of butter, without salt


 - 30 g of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Soften the butter in the microwave. Cream the softened butter and sugar in a bowl. Sift in the cake flour into the bowl, and continue mixing. When the dough comes together, place the dough between 2 sheets of plastic wrap, and roll out the dough until it is 5 mm thick. Take off the plastic wrap on top, and cut out the dough into any shape you like. Place the cookies onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Bake in the oven preheated to 170C for 12-15 minutes. For matcha cookies: Add 2 g of matcha to half the ingredients listed above. For cocoa cookies: Add 5 g of cocoa powder to half the ingredients listed above. For cinnamon cookies: Add cinnamon as much as you like to the cookie dough. I decorated the cookies with my child using chocolate decorating pens.

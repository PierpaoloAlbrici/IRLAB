### Ingredients

 - 3/4 cup of sugars, brown

 - 3/4 cup of butter, without salt

 - 3 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

 - 1/2 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 2 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

### Instructions

Combine sucanat, Crisco, hot water, applesauce, and vanilla in bowl. Mix well. The hot water melts the sucanat so that it is no longer grainy. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. Use a whisk to combine well. Slowly add flour to wet mixture and mix until combined. Stir chocolate chips in with a wooden spoon. Scoop onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. I did about 1 tablespoon of dough per scoop. Bake in a preheated 375 degrees oven. Bake for 4 minutes and use the back of a wooden spoon to flatten the cookies out (it works better once the dough is warm, rather than flattening before baking). Continue baking for another 4 minutes.

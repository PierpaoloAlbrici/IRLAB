Mock Tahini


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried


 - 2-3 tablespoon of oil, sesame, salad or cooking


 - 12 teaspoon of oil, sesame, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

If you have the time, lightly toast the sesame seeds and allow to cool then proceed. If pressed for time, bypass the toasting. In food processor or blender combine all *ingredients and blend until relatively smooth. Add more oil if necessary to aid in blending. There definitely will be whole seeds remaining no matter how well you blend, and that's okay. Mixture will be very oily and not very smooth. (Remember, this is an emergency!) ;). If time permits, allow tahini to set for 30 minutes. NOTE: If you don't have any time available to toast or blend the seeds then omit those steps and add the whole seeds and oil directly into your recipe, depending of course on what you are preparing. It's a judgment call. Very important to be sure your sesame seeds are fresh before starting this recipe! If not, your tahini will taste rancid. ALWAYS keep sesame seeds refrigerated! Refrigerate any leftover tahini. *Bear in mind that my measurements are approximated. Adjust amounts accordingly.

Madi's Favorite Green Beans


Ingredients


 - 14 ounce of beans, snap, green, raw


 - 14 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 dash of spices, garlic powder


 - 1 dash of salt, table


 - 1 dash of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Add green beans to a non-stick pan with a lid. Set burner to medium-low. Add water (you can add more if needed). You want to cover and steam till your green beans are soft and to your liking. Check every so often, maybe do a taste test. Once they are cooked, remove most of the water, a little water left over is okay. Add butter and garlic powder to taste. i think it is safe to say about 1/4 a teaspoon is a good measurement not over-doing it. Cook until desired doneness. you can just cook them in butter till it coats them well or saute them a little. Add desired amount of salt and pepper. Dont over-do it! You can always add more salt or pepper, even garlic powder when it is on your plate.

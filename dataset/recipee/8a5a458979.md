 - 12 cup of peaches, yellow, raw

 - 4 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 3 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 12 cup of honey

Place sliced peaches and water in a large (8 quart) pot and cook over medium heat until peaches are soft, about 20 to 25 minutes. Stir frequently to prevent the peaches from sticking. When fruit is tender, stir in lemon juice and honey. Put peach mixture through a food mill, or blend in a blender or food processor until smooth. Pour into two shallow 9x13 inch baking pans or roasting pans. Bake uncovered for one hour at 325*F. ,stirring every 15 to 20 minutes. Continue baking until the butter is thick, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. The peach butter will be thick, fine-textured, and a rich reddish-amber color. To can, pour hot peach butter (at least 160*F.) into clean half-pint jars. Process in boiling water for 10 minutes. Butter can also be frozen. To serve, defrost in the refrigerator overnight. Yield: 2 1/2 to 3 cups.

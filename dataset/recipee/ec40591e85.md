### Ingredients

 - 5 cup of candies, marshmallows

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 13 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

 - 2 cup of pretzels, soft, unsalted

 - 1 1/2 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 2 cup of corn, sweet, white, raw

### Instructions

Melt butter and peanut butter in a microwave-safe dish. Add the mini-mallows and microwave until smooth, stirring frequently. In a separate, large mixing bowl, combine the M&M's, Chex, and pretzels. Pour the mallow mixture over the Chex mixture, and stir to coat (will be a little messy and gooey!) Pour (or rather, plop) entire works into a 9x13 pan and spread it so it is even. I spray the pan with Pam so they're easier to remove later. Let cool, cut into squares, and enjoy!

Strawberry Syrup


Ingredients


 - 1 pint of strawberries, raw


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 14 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

Process strawberries in a food processor until smooth. Pour strawberry puree through a wire-mesh strainer into a saucepan, discarding seeds. Stir in sugar and juice; cook over low heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce heat, and simmer 5 minutes, while skimming froth from top. Remove from heat; cool. Enjoy! Makes 2 1/4 cups.

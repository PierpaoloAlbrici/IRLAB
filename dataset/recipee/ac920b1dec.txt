 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Add vinegar or lemon juice to milk and set aside. Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add to food processor or high-powered blender. Cut butter into 1/2-inch cubes. Add to flour and pulse about 7 or 8 times, or until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Pour in milk and pulse just until mixture starts to stick together. Turn out onto lightly floured surface. Work salmon and chives into dough. Knead a few times until you can form a ball and flatten out into a 9-inch disk. Using a biscuit cutter, cut out rounds and place on parchment-lined baking sheet. If you have scrap dough, flatten out again and cut out more rounds. For the glaze, mix salt with water and brush tops of biscuits. Bake in preheated oven for 1517 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from oven and serve warm or place on rack to cool. If you have leftovers, wrap in plastic wrap and place in a plastic bag. Reheat in a 325 degrees F oven for about 8 minutes.

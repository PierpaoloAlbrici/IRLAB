Roasted Corn and Tomato Relish


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of corn, sweet, white, raw


 - 1 cup of tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average


 - 13 cup of peppers, sweet, green, raw


 - 13 cup of fresh red onions, upc: 888670013229


 - 2 tablespoon of vinegar, balsamic


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, thyme, dried


Instructions: 

Soak cleaned corn in a bowl of water for approximately 30 minutes. Heat a grill and place corn straight on the cooking surface. Cook until beautiful black & caramelized grill marks appear, turning frequently. DO NOT BOIL OR MICROWAVE CORN (sorry, but this is a big obnoxious NO-NO with me) or you will lose all of the sweet natural flavor. Once corn has cooled enough to handle, cut off all of kernels. Add all of the remaining ingredients and mix together. Serve at room temperature or cold.

Instructions: 

In a food processor, finely chop the remaining 1/3 cup almonds and pour onto a plate. Set aside for later. In a food processor, roughly chop 1 cup almonds. Pour into a medium size bowl. Add almonds, sunflower seeds, cacao nibs, chia seeds, and toasted coconut. Mix with a fork until well combined. In a food processor or blender, puree the currants with water. In a small sauce pan over a low heat, combine the currant/water mixture with the almond butter, honey, and cocoa powder. Mix with a fork until well incorporated. Pour the liquid mixture into the large bowl and mix with a rubber spatula allowing the chia seeds to soak up some of the liquid. Set aside for 5 minutes. Once the mixture cools, fold in the 2 tablespoons of dark chocolate chips. Using a large spoon, scoop the mixture and roll into a ball. The size should be slightly smaller than a golf ball. Roll the ball in the finely chopped almonds. Repeat to make roughly 20-24 mini bites. Store in an air-tight container in the refrigerator and eat throughout the week.

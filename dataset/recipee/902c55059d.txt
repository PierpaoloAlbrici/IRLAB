Apricot Scones


Ingredients


 - 13 cup of butter, without salt


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 cup of apricots, dried, sulfured, uncooked


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 1 teaspoon of orange juice, raw


 - 1 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Cut butter into small pieces and store in the refrigerator or freezer while preparing other ingredients. Stir flour, sugar, baking powder and salt together in a large bowl. Using a pastry blender or two forks, cut in butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Stir in apricot bits, pecans and orange peel. With a fork, quickly stir in one cup heavy cream until dough is just moistened (if there is still a lot of dry flour left, add another tablespoon of heavy cream and mix). Gather dough together in a rough ball and turn onto a floured surface. Knead 5 or 6 times. For large scones, press dough into an 8x8 cake pan, then turn the square of dough onto the lightly floured surface and cut into eight triangles (sort of like cutting a pizza). For small scones, divide dough in half. Roll half of the dough into a circle and cut into eight wedges. Repeat with the other half of the dough. Regardless of size of scones, place them one inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet. Brush lightly with heavy cream. Bake about 13 minutes for small scones or about 20 minutes for larger scones.

Instructions: 

Prepare a large cookie sheet or jelly roll pan by coating it with butter. Melt butter in a heavy 2-quart saucepan. Add sugar, corn syrup and water and cook until hard crack stage (300 degrees F or, as Mom says, cook until it is the same color as an old penny). Immediately pour onto prepared pan. Wait only a couple minutes for it to solidify then, while its still warm, spread milk chocolate on top. Allow the heat of the toffee to melt the chocolate then spread chocolate with a spatula. Sprinkle almonds on top and lightly press into melted chocolate. When completely cool, break into pieces and store in a covered container.

Cinnamon Dessert Stromboli


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 1/3 tablespoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 5 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 5 tablespoon of nuts, pecans


Instructions: 

Combine butter, cinnamon, sugar, and pecans in a small bowl; set aside. Roll out bread dough into a rectangle, approximately 1/8" thick; be sure it's not longer than your baking pan! (If it springs back too much, let the dough rest before rolling some more. ). Spread the sugar mixure onto the center of the dough, leaving 1/2" at the ends and enough bare dough on the sides for folding over. Bring the long sides in to form a seam on the top; pinch together well. Fold the ends in; pinch, or press closed with a fork- it can easily open while baking and all the yummy sugar mixture will run out! Bake at 350 for about 25 minutes; remove when nicely browned. Let rest for 15 minutes, then slice and enjoy!

 - 8 cup of apples, raw, with skin


 - 1/3-1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 1/2-2 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 18 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground

Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Grease an 8x8 inch glass baking dish. In a large bowl, combine the apple slices, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Toss to coat the apples and transfer to the prepared baking dish. To make the topping, combine oats, brown sugar, flour and cinnamon in a medium bowl. Add the butter pieces, and with your fingers, rub the butter in the mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle this mixture over the apples. Bake for 40 minutes or until apples are tender.

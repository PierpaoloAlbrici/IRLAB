Butter Crunch Popcorn


Ingredients


 - 8 cup of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)


 - 2 cup of nuts, walnuts, english


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/4 cup of syrups, corn, light

Instructions: 

Pop the corn in oil, then spread the popped corn on a large greased sheet pan. Mix in the salted nuts and set aside. In a heavy large skillet, melt butter and combine with sugar, salt and corn syrup. Stir well & let simmer over medium heat, without stirring, until the mixture reaches 302 degrees on a candy thermometer. Carefully swirl the pan every few minutes. When candy is ready, stir in the vanilla and carefully pour the mixture over the popcorn and nuts. Stir to coat and let cool at least an hour. Store in an airtight container.

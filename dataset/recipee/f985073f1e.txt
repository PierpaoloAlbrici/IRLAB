Kings Arms Confections


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of egg, white, raw, fresh


 - 1 3/4 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 12 cup of nuts, pecans


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 200. Beat egg whites until stiff. Fold in brown sugar while beating egg whites. Add the lemon juice. Fold in the sifted flour and pecans. Drop by spoonfuls onto very lightly sprayed baking sheet. Bake for 25-30 minutes. These are really drying instead of baking. If using a hand mixer beating the whites will take 10-15 minutes to become stiff. If using a kitchen aid it will take about 5 minutes.

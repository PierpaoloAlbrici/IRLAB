Ingredients


 - 135 g of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 20 g of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 50 g of honey


Instructions: 

Chop up the chocolate and melt over a double boiler (about 50C). The chocolate might separate if the temperature is too high. Warm the chocolate to the touch. Combine syrup and mizuame in another bowl and warm over a double boiler [about 30C]. Combine the warmed Steps 2 and 3 together. Pour the mixture onto a parchment paper, place a plastic wrap to cover and chill thoroughly in the refrigerator. Let it sit for a day if possible. Knead to evenly incorporate. Then it is ready. Dust cocoa powder on your hands and shape like clay. You can also roll out the chocolate and cut out with cookie cutters Use melted chocolate as glue. [For a rose] Place Step 6 on a new parchment paper and place a plastic wrap on. Roll out the chocolate to be thin [about 3 mm-to your liking]. Core =1 circle Flower petals = heart shape cookie cutters [or flower petals shapes] and cut out as needed. The amount of petals depends on the size of the flower. Core = Cut the round shape into half, let them over lap each other and roll to the arrow direction. Wrap and stick the petals to the core. Shape nicely depending on how the whole shape looks. Repeat this process and make your desired size. This is made with core = 1 piece, and petals = 5 pieces. The picture is for how it looks like form the side. Cut off the excess. The rose will look beautiful if you make the edges of the petal thin and wavy. The rose in the picture is pretty big. I used core = 1 pieces and petals = 8 pieces. For spirals, spread out Step 6 on half of a parchment paper and make cuts. Use the other half of the parchment paper and place the chocolate in between. Wrap the chocolate onto a rolling pin or a core of a plastic wrap, and let it chill. Remove the parchment paper form the stick. Remove the parchment paper form the chocolate. It's prone to cracking. Wrapping Step 17 to a stick is easier to make the spirals. [Arrangement]

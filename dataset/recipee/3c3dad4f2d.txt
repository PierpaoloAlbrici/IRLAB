NOTES : I just finished making Apple Vanilla Rice Pudding and realized the instructions are given only for half of the apple juice being used. I checked the book, and believe it or possibly not, the printed instructions were the same - so I just mixed the rest of the apple juice in the blender with the remaining ingredients, it*looks* OK, but I have yet to try it. I think I sent it last week.

Blueberry Basil Martini Pops


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 cup of syrups, sugar free


 - 1 1/2 cup of spices, basil, dried


 - 4 cup of blueberries, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 1/4 cup of alcoholic beverage, distilled, vodka, 80 proof


Instructions: 

Combine the water and sugar together in a small pot. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar completely dissolves. Add the basil and stir. Remove from the heat, cover and cool to room temperature to make a basil-infused simple syrup. Strain, discarding the solids. Puree the blueberries, lemon juice and basil syrup in your blender in batches. Strain into a large bowl, mashing the puree around with a spoon to extract as much as liquid as you can. Discard the solids. Whisk with vodka. Fill the pop molds with the blueberry mixture leaving 1/4 inch at the top. Freeze until slushy, then insert a stick in each. Freeze overnight, until solid.

 - 6 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 3 to 4 cup of oil, corn, peanut, and olive


Instructions: 

Bring four to five cups of water to a boil in a wok. Place walnuts in boiling water for five minutes to remove bitter taste. Remove from water and drain, then run cold water over the walnuts. Drain again, then place back in the wok with another four cups of water. Bring to a boil and cook for another five minutes. Repeat draining process. Set aside and let drain. Wash wok. Add 6 tablespoons of water and bring to a boil. Then add sugar, constantly stirring. Let boil for 1 minute and add walnuts. Stir until the nuts are coated with glaze and remaining liquid in wok has evaporated. Remove walnuts and set aside. Wash wok with extremely hot water to remove sugar and dry. Place peanut oil in wok. Bring to a boil (look for a wisp of white smoke), then add walnuts. Fry for 4 to 5 minutes, or until walnuts turn light golden brown.

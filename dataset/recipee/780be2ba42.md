### Ingredients

 - 500 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 15 g of sugars, granulated

 - 7 1/2 g of salt, table

 - 10 g of milk, canned, condensed, sweetened

 - 10 g of egg substitute, powder

 - 10 g of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt

 - 280 ml of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Dissolve sugar and salt in water. Add milk, egg and flour and blend well. Add the margarine. Knead the dough until smooth and no longer sticky. Divide dough into 70 g pieces. Shape the dough into balls and coat with margarine. Cover the dough and leave for about five hours or overnight. Gently press the dough with palm, stretching it slightly. Hold the dough and stretch to expand the dough piece. Repeat this step for about eight times. (Or you can toss it like a pizza maker, I've seen this done and it's awesome). Finally you should get a piece of thin sheet of dough. Fold up or coil into a lump. Leave the dough for ten minutes. Fry on both sides over medium heat until golden brown. Serve Roti Canai with Curry.

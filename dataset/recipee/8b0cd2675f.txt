Claudia Roden's Basic Couscous


Ingredients


 - 1 1/4 cup of couscous, dry


 - 1 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Mix warm water with salt. Place couscous into an oven-safe dish. Gradually add salted water, stirring vigorously so that it is absorbed evenly. Leave to swell for about 10 minutes, then mix in oil and rub the couscous between your hands above the bowl to air it and break up any lumps. That is the important part. Put the dish in an oven preheated to 400F and heat through for 20 minutes, or until it is steaming hot. Before serving, work in butter and fluff it up again, breaking up any lumps.

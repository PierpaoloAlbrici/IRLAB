Maple-Roasted Brussels Sprouts With Toasted Hazelnuts


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 pound of brussels sprouts, raw


 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 3/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 2 tablespoon of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, hazelnuts or filberts


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. To prepare the brussels sprouts, remove any yellow or brown outer leaves, cut off the stems and cut in half. In a large bowl, toss the brussels sprouts, olive oil, salt and pepper together. Once all of the brussels sprouts are coated in oil, spread them into a 9-by-13-inch (or larger) baking dish or sheet tray to roast. Note: You may want to line your sheet tray with foil for easy cleanup because the caramelizing process leaves a sticky residue. After 15 minutes, stir the brussels sprouts with a spatula or large spoon to even out the browning. After 30 minutes, stir in the maple syrup. (Steps 1 through 4 can be done a day in advance; store covered in the refrigerator. Continue with Steps 5 and 6 right before serving.) Continue to roast the brussels sprouts for about 15 more minutes, or until they are fork tender (about 45 minutes total roasting time). Toss the roasted brussels sprouts with the hazelnuts and devour!

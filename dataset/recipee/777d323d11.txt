Croatian Pork Crisps (cvarci)


Ingredients


 - 1300 g of bacon, meatless


 - 10 g of onions, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Cut the bacon in cubes approximately 2 cm large. Put it in a large pot and fry it gently until bacon melts. If you want them gold put milk, but than the fat product is not so good (for later cooking). When you see cvarci became gold in colour and start to chirp put the whole onion in it and let it fry for 3 tp 6 minutes. Drain cvarci and save the liquid fat (lard) in a pot. You can use it for preparing food.

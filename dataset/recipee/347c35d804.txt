Caramel Frosting VI


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of sugars, brown


 - 2 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1/4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1/3 cup of nuts, pecans


Instructions: 

In a shallow 6-inch saucepan, thoroughly mix brown sugar and flour. Stir in butter and milk, and cook over medium-high heat until mixture comes to a rolling boil. Boil exactly 1-1/2 minutes. Remove from heat. Allow to cool 5 minutes. Beat with a wooden spoon until mixture begins to thicken. Mix in vanilla and continue beating until frosting is the consistency of thick honey, no more than 1 to 2 minutes. Immediately pour caramel frosting onto cooled cake and quickly spread with the back of a warm spoon before frosting begins to set up. Quickly sprinkle top of cake with toasted pecans. Frosting will set up completely in a few hours.

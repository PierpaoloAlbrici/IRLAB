### Ingredients

 - 8 ounce of crustaceans, shrimp, raw (not previously frozen)

 - 1 tablespoon of cornstarch

 - 4 tablespoon of orange juice, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, brown

 - 1 tablespoon of vinegar, cider

 - 1/2 tablespoon of spices, ginger, ground

 - 2 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 tablespoon of tomato products, canned, puree, without salt added

 - 2 tablespoon of pineapple, raw, all varieties

### Instructions

Mix the cornflour with the orange juice until smooth. Put all the other ingredients except the prawns into a saucepan, add the orange juice and cornflour and bring to the boil, stirring regularly until thick and smooth. If you want a reddish-coloured sauce add the tomato puree and, if you like the flavour, add the crushed pineapple, or both. Put in the prawns and heat through for just two minutes, don't cook them too long or they'll turn rubbery. Serve with plenty of rice and stir-fried beansprouts.

### Ingredients

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 3/4 cup of celery, raw

 - 1/4 cup of onions, raw

 - 4 ounce of mushrooms, white, raw

 - 1/2 cup of cream, sour, cultured

 - 1/2 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular

 - 2 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 2 cup of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw

 - 3/4 cup of potatoes, raw, skin

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add celery and onion and cook until tender, 2 to 4 minutes, adding mushrooms about halfway through. Turn off heat. Stir in the sour cream, mayonnaise, lemon juice, salt and pepper, mixing thoroughly. Stir in the cooked chicken (you can use the meat from leftovers, or bake/broil chicken breast just for this), coating well. Spread into 1 1/2 quart casserole dish, and spread with the crushed potato chips. Bake for 25-30 minutes at 350 degrees. (I always make a double or triple batch when I take this somewhere.)

Candy Making," by Apollo Mold Company. It's pretty good, though you have to be careful to use sufficient coloring and flavoring! In a saucepan, blend sugar, corn syrup, and water. Bring to a boil over high heat till mix reaches 290 degrees Fahrenheit. Stir frequently with a metal (not wood) spoon. Remove pan from heat. Allow to stand till bubbles have simmered down. Add in flavoring and color, as desired. Too much stirring will cause the syrup to solidify into a hard sugary lump. Mold into desired shapes in Apollo Hard Candy Molds sprayed lightly with a nonstick vegetable oil spray. Work fast. If mix becomes too cool and thick, it may be warmed for a few seconds in a microwave. When hard candies are completely cooled, store them in airtight containers or possibly place them, individually, in 3- by 5-inch plastic sucker bags. /CANDY

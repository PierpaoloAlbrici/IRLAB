### Ingredients

 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 pound of strawberries, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 13 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

### Instructions

In a small sauce pot over medium heat, make a simple syrup by adding sugar and water and stirring until sugar is completely dissolved. Let sugar water boil for about 1 minute. Remove from heat and transfer to a heat safe container. Chill in refrigerator until completely chilled. While the simple syrup is chilling, add washed and hulled strawberries to a food processer/blender. Transfer to a stainless steel bowl. Add lemon juice to strawberry puree and stir well. Stir in the peanut butter. Add chilled simple syrup to strawberry and lemon juice mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze for at least 3 hours or until the sorbet has had time to freeze through. Set out and allow it to thaw slightly. Add back to food processor/blender and puree again. Transfer sorbet back to stainless steel bowl, cover and freeze again. Once sorbet has frozen completely, serve and enjoy!

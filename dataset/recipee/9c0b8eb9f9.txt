Old Fashioned Cinnamon Vanilla Rice Pudding


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 3 1/2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1/2 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

In a 3-quart or larger stock pot, pour all the ingredients and stir well to combine. It takes a minute to stir in all the cinnamon, but it will stir in. Once everything is combined, put a lid on the pot and bring to a boil. Keep an eye on it! It will boil over without any notice. Once it is boiling, give it a good stir and place the lid back on and reduce to low and simmer for 45-50 minutes or until it is thick and creamy, stirring every 10 minutes or so. I turned mine to a little above low in the last 10 minutes. Serve warm. Super yummy! Serves 4-6. Enjoy!

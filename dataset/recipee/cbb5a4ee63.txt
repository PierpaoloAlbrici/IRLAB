Parmesan Pepperoncini Crisps


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 pinch of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 F. Place a sheet of parchment paper on a lightly greased baking sheet. Place 1 tablespoon sized scoops of cheese on the parchment leaving some space between each. Sprinkle with a pinch of pepperoncini. Flatten cheese slightly. Sprinkle with black pepper. Bake for 9 to 11 minutes or until edges turn lightly golden. Remove pan from oven. At this point, you may leave the crisps flat by allowing them to cool until ready to use. If you like to shape them, work with them while they are hot. Place the handle of a wooden spoon in the center of a crisp. Fold in the two sides (at the 4 oclock and 8 oclock position) around the spoon. Hold and squeeze for a minute. Slide crisp off spoon. Repeat until all crisps are shaped (shaping two at a time will speed up the process). If the unshaped crisps harden and become difficult to shape, place them individually in the oven for a few seconds and they will become pliable again.

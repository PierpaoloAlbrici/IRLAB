Cheese Straws


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 8 ounce of cheese, cheddar


 - 5 ounce of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


 - 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 400F (200C). In a large bowl, mix flour, salt, cayenne pepper, and cheese thoroughly. Add melted margarine and mix. Chill dough in refrigerator for 20 minutes. Place dough on a large, floured board. Place a large piece of waxed paper on top of dough or use a heavily-floured rolling pin. Roll dough to 1/4 inch thick. Remove wax paper. Holding a fork upside down, draw the prongs vertically along dough from top to bottom, making ridges. With a wide, flat knife cut dough into rectangular shapes 3x1 inch. Oil a cookie sheet and place cut cheese on it. Bake in 400F (200C) oven for 10 to 12 minutes until cheese straws look dry but not brown. Let cool. Repeat procedure until all of dough is baked. Serve at room-temperature. Freezes well.

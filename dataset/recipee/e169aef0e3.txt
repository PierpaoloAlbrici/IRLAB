Itoko-ni Pumpkin and Azuki bean


Ingredients


 - 500 g of pumpkin, raw


 - 100 g of jams and preserves, apricot


 - 200 ml of water, bottled, generic


 - 2/3 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


Instructions: 

Cut the pumpkin in pieces (bite-size). I prefer leaving some skin as in the photo. Put the pumpkin in a pot, add the water and soy sauce and boil. When boiled, cover with a lid and keep cooking for 10-15 minutes. Turn the pumpkin in the middle if necessary. When the pumpkin gets soft, add the bean jam and cook for about a couple of minutes. Enjoy!

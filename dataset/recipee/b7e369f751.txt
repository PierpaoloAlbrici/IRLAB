Basic Tempered Chocolate


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022


Instructions: 

Melt 1 1/2 cups of the chocolate in a bowl over a double boiler. Stir constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to ensure uniform temperature. Set the remaining 1/2 cup chocolate aside. Once the chocolate has fully melted and reached a temperature of 105 F to 108 F (102 to 104 F for milk or white chocolate), remove it from the heat. At this temperature, all the crystals will melt and stabilize. Add the remaining chocolate that was set aside and stir. Be aware: If the chocolate rises above 120 F (118 F for milk or white chocolate), it will be unusable for tempering. Stir until the chocolates temperature cools to between 82 and 84 F (80 and 82 F for milk or white chocolate). Return the bowl to the double boiler and heat slightly until the temperature is 86 to 88 F (82 to 84 F for milk or white chocolate), about 1 minute. Use the chocolate as soon as possible, or keep it at this temperature over a pot of simmering water until ready to use. Be sure to continue to stir it and monitor the temperature closely. Take the chocolate off the heat if the temperature begins to rise toward 90 F (86 F for milk or white chocolate). Please note: The longer you wait to use it, the more likely the chocolate will be out of temper. Chocolate is easier to temper in larger quantities because the temperature wont fluctuate as quickly. For that reason, it is always advisable to temper more chocolate than you think youll need. That way you wont be left short and needing to temper only a small additional quantity. Unused tempered chocolate can be poured onto a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and used for baking or re-tempering.

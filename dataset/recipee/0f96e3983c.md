### Ingredients

 - 100 g of butter, without salt

 - 70 g of sugars, granulated

 - 140 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 60 g of nuts, almonds

### Instructions

Take butter out of fridge and leave it for a while to soften enough for stirring. Stir butter, add sugar, and stir fully enough to make it white and fluffy. Add wheat flour and almond powder, stir them softly with a spatula. Be careful not to make them too sticky by mixing them persistently. Put it in a plastic bag and make it flat with a rolling pin. Chill it in a fridge more than one hour. Heat the oven to 170C. Cut the dough into 3x3cm pieces and bake them 20 minutes, approximately. It would depend on the oven, so check the color closely. Cool them completely on a clean sheet. Note: you can keep the dough for about 2 weeks in the fridge. Enjoy freshly baked cookies whenever you like!

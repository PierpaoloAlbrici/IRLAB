Mendiants - Beautiful Little Chocolates


Ingredients


 - 8 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 2 tablespoon of nuts, pistachio nuts, raw


 - 12 cup of raisins, seeded


 - 12 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 4 ounce of orange juice, raw


Instructions: 

Place a sheet of waxed paper on a marble slab or other smooth, cold surface. Melt chocolate in a microwave oven or in a bowl over hot water. (To make life easier only melt 1/2 the chocolate first then the other half). Place a scant teaspoonful of melted chocolate on the sheet, and shape into a disk using the back of a spoon. Make several at a time so that the chocolate does not become too cool. Place a pistachio, raisin, almond, and halved strip of orange peel on each disk, and leave to cool completely. The mendiants are ready when they come off the waxed paper with ease.

Butterscotch Sauce


Ingredients


 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 34 cup of sugars, brown


 - 34 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 12 cup of nuts, hazelnuts or filberts


Instructions: 

Melt the butter and sugar in a heavy pan, bring to a boil and boil for 2 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes. Heat evaporated milk to just below the boiling point, then gradually stir into the sugar mixture. Cook over low heat for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Spread the haxlenuts on a baking sheet and toast in a hot oven. Slide the nuts onto a clean dish, towel and rub them briskly to remove the skins. Chop the nuts coarsely and stir into the sauce. Serve hot poured over ice cream and warm waffles or pancakes.

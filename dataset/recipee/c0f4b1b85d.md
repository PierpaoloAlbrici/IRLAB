### Ingredients

 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1/3 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1/4 cup of honey

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 cup of oats

 - 1 3/4 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

 - 1/2 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 1/4 cup of wheat germ, crude

 - 1/3 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 719283140692

### Instructions

Line a 9 - 13 inch baking pan with aluminum foil. Then spray the foil lightly with a nonstick cooking spray. Combine the butter, light brown sugar, and honey in a large pot. Then bring it to a boil over medium high heat. Stir constantly to avoid burning. Lower the heat to allow the mixture to thicken, then remove the pan away from the heat and add the salt and vanilla. Next begin adding the Instant Oats, Rice Krispies, almonds, and flax meal (or wheat germ). Mix it all by folding the ingredients together using a rubber spatula. Next spread and press the mixture into the baking pan along with the chocolate chips on the top. Make sure the mixture is firmly compacted within the pan, then place it into the refrigerator for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. After the granola is refrigerated place it onto a cutting board and cut into small rectangles. Store bars in an airtight container and layer the bars with parchment paper or foil. Enjoy!

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of oats

 - 2 1/2 ounce of beverages, protein powder whey based

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1/4 cup of salt, table

 - 1/4 cup of beverages, almond milk, unsweetened, shelf stable

 - 8 drop of sweetener, herbal extract powder from stevia leaf

 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 13 cup of nuts, almonds

### Instructions

In a medium size bowl mix together all dry ingredients (oats through salt) until well incorporated. Mix in unsweetened almond milk, stevia drops, and vanilla extract. Next, heat up the almond butter so it is easy to work with (just takes a few seconds in the microwave). Then pour the melted almond butter into the dough mixture and stir or use a hand mixer until evenly distributed. Place dough in the refrigerator for 45 minutes to an hour to harden a bit. Roll into 20 balls to devour immediately or place in a resealable plastic container to store in the refrigerator.

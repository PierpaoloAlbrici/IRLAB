Mommoms Salad Dressing


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 1 tablespoon of vinegar, cider


 - 4 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Combine all ingredients in a bowl or jar. Whisk or shake until sugar is dissolved. Drizzle over salad. I love this with fresh iceberg, tomatoes and cucumbers. If youre preparing this with heavy cream (preferred), you can whip it up at the last minute. Its absolutely perfect, rich and creamy (but not overly so). It thickens and can even be used as a very mild dip after sitting in the fridge for a bit. You can also make this with light cream if youre preparing it ahead of time, since this dressing tends to thicken.

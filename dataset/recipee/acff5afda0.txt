Chocolate-Raspberry Ice Cream


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 5 tablespoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


 - 2/3 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 cup of raspberries, raw


Instructions: 

Whisk together the cream, cocoa powder, and sugar in a large saucepan. Heat the mixture, whisking frequently, until it comes to a full, rolling boil (it will start to foam up). Remove from the heat and add the raspberries. Cover and let stand for 10 minutes. Puree the mixture in a food processor or blender. If you wish, press the mixture through a mesh strainer to remove the seeds. Chill the mixture thoroughly, then freeze it in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturers instructions.

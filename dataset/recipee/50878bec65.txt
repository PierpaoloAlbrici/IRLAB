Vegan Waffle Batter - Made in the Thermomix


Ingredients


 - 15 g of sugars, granulated


 - 100 g of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 400 g of beverages, almond milk, unsweetened, shelf stable


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 300 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


Instructions: 

Mill sugar 3 seconds/speed 9. Add cooking oil, non-dairy milk, and vanilla extract. Mix 5 seconds/speed 4. Add in the salt and flour. Mix 10 seconds/speed 6. Set speed to 6 and pour the baking powder in through the hole in the lid. Following the directions on your waffle iron - go ahead and cook up your waffles! This recipe makes puffier waffles than the old eggy/buttery one I used to use. Perhaps spread the batter a little thinner in your iron than you usually do.

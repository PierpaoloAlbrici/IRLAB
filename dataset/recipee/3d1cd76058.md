### Ingredients

 - 200 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 130 g of butter, without salt

 - 60 g of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 180C/350F. Combine flour, butter or margarine and sugar in a bowl. Mix them with your fingers until the texture becomes crumbly, but make sure not to mash the texture. Make a soft dough and put it into a square/rectangular plastic food bag. Make sure the bag is laid square and flat on the table and then roll out the dough to between 5mm to 10 mm thickness. Once rolled put in fridge for half an hour or more. After cooling in the fridge, gently take the dough out from the bag (might be easier to cut the bag) and then cut the dough into 3 x 5 cm rectangles. Next prick the top evenly along each piece with a fork before baking. Cover an oven tray with grease proof cooking paper and place on it the biscuits evenly. Bake for about 15 min. Once cooked, leave to cool and enjoy!

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 3/4 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of sweet potato, raw, unprepared

 - 2 tablespoon of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Whisk flour, baking powder, sugar, pepper, baking soda, and salt together in a large mixing bowl. Cut butter into the flour mixture with a pastry cutter or fork until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir sweet potatoes and cream into the flour mixture until the dough is soft. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface; knead the dough, turning over about 5 times. Roll to about 1/2-inch thick. Cut 2-inch circles out of dough and arrange on a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes.

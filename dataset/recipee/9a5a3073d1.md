### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 cup of syrups, corn, light

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cloves, ground

 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 3 3/4-4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

In a medium mixing bowl, cream butter or margarine, sugar and corn syrup. When well combined, stir in cinnamon, cloves and baking soda mixture. Slowly add flour and mix well after each addition until dough becomes stiff. Cover dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, approximately one hour. This time is included in the preparation time. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. On a floured surface, roll dough to 1/8-inch thickness. Using a reindeer or desired shaped cookie cutter, cut shapes into dough. Dough can also be rolled into logs about 1-inch in diameter and sliced crosswise into 1-inch-thick rounds. Bake on ungreased cookie sheets until lightly browned, about 8 to 10 minutes.

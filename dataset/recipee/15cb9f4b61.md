### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of blueberries, raw

 - 1 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 12 cup of amazonas rainforest product, tapioca starch, upc: 742987126365

### Instructions

If you are using frozen blueberries, thaw before using. In a mixing bowl, mix together sugar and tapioca starch until well mixed. Reserve 1/2 cup of mixture to be used for adding to the base of the pastry. Add remaining sugar mixture to the blueberries and carefully mix well to coat berries. Let mixture sit for about 5 minutes before using. Add 1/2 teaspoon of sugar/tapioca starch mixture to the dough rounds or pastry cups. Add about 1 1/2 tablespoons of blueberries into either the regular dough or the pastry dough. Bake in preheated 400 F oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until crust is just lightly browned.

Instructions: 

Rinse and clean chicken. Leave it whole or cut into parts. If you decide to grill chicken, I suggest leaving the skin on, otherwise remove skin. Whisk arrowroot with cold water until well blended. Mix with rest of ingredients except chicken. Rub all over chicken and let stand ~ 30 minutes at room temperature (I put mine into the cold microwave to marinate. ). Roast ~25 minutes in a pre-heated 350F oven. Lower heat to 300F and continue roasting another 20 minutes or until juices run clear when thigh is pierced.

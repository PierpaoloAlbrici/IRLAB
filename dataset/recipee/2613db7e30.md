[2613db7e30](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/appetizers-and-snacks/beer-cheese-dip-2/)

### Ingredients

 - 8 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 2 cup of cheese, cheddar

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, parsley, dried

 - 1/4 teaspoon of dill weed, fresh

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, onion powder

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, basil, dried

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 13 cup of alcoholic beverage, beer, regular, all

### Instructions

Throw all ingredients except beer into a food processor and blend until fully combined. Start by adding 1/4 cup of beer and pulse; add more to reach desired dipping consistency. (I usually dont measure, but I believe I usually end up using about 1/3 cup.) Drink the rest of the beer and dip away! Note: This can totally be made ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator. Just be sure to let it sit out at room temperature for a while before you need it so the dip becomes soft again.

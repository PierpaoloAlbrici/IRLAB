Vanilla & Chocolate Swirls


Ingredients


 - 4 ounce of butter, without salt


 - 4 ounce of sugars, granulated


 - 8 ounce of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 13 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


Instructions: 

You will have to make the dough twice using the first 4 ingredients but adding the vanilla and the cacao to the different batches. If the dough is too soft to roll out, wrap it up and put in the fridge to firm up. On baking parchment/paper roll out the vanilla dough into a rectangle approx 1/4 inch thick. Do the same with the chocolate dough, use flour for rolling if the dough is sticky. Use hands and/or fingers to shape or patch, so they will end up the same size as much as possible. Lift chocolate dough with paper and invert on top of the vanilla, press the two layers firmly together, shape if necessary. Grip the paper on the long side of the rectangle and use it to help roll up the dough like a Swiss Roll. By this time the dough is probably too soft again and you will have to put it back into the fridge until firm. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Take dough out of the fridge and cut into approx 1/4 inch slices, put on baking tray{s} and bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Leave to cool for 5 minutes when they come out of the oven before you lift them off the tray.

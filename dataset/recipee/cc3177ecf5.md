### Ingredients

 - 200 g of sweet potato, raw, unprepared

 - 10 g of sugars, granulated

 - 50 ml of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 80 g of butter, without salt

 - 50 g of sugars, granulated

 - 200 g of sweet potato, raw, unprepared

 - 110 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched

 - 40 g of nuts, almonds

### Instructions

Make the sweet potato paste. Peel the sweet potatoes and soak in water for 10 minutes to get rid of any bitterness. Boil the sweet potatoes in just enough water to cover. They are done once they change color and brighten up, and a bamboo skewer goes through a piece easily. While they are still warm, put the sweet potatoes in a food processor with the sugar and milk, and process until smooth. Make the dough. Preheat the oven to 190 C. Mix the butter, which should be at room temperature, and the sugar together very well. Measure out 200 g of the sweet potato paste you made in step 3 and add to the butter-sugar mix. Mix until smooth. Sift in the cake and almond flours and fold them in. Use your hands to form balls with the dough. Lightly flatten each ball, and line them up on your baking pan (You can form the dough in any shape you like.) Bake in the preheated oven for 12 minutes. Once the bottom has turned golden brown, they are done! They're also delicious warmed up in a toaster oven just before eating.

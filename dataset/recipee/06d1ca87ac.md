### Ingredients

 - 4 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 14 cup of syrup, maple, canadian

 - 3 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 2/3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Mix the topping ingredients together on a flat plate. Set aside. In a medium mixing bowl, use a fork to vigorously mix together butter, sugar, honey, and milk. Mix in vanilla. Sift in remaining ingredients, stirring as you add them. Once all ingredients are added, mix until youve got a pliable dough. Roll dough into walnut sized balls (if you're measuring, 18g balls). Pat into the sugar topping to flatten into roughly 2 inch discs. Transfer to baking sheet, sugar side up, at least 2 inches apart (they spread). Bake for 8-10 minutes, removing from oven once they are a bit spread and crackly on top. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.

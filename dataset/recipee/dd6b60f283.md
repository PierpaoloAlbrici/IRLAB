### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1/2 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 1 cup of candies, marshmallows

 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 3/4 cup of nuts, walnuts, english

 - 3/4 cup of peppermint, fresh

### Instructions

Line a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with strips of waxed or parchment paper; coat evenly with cooking spray. Set aside. Combine sugar, salt, butter, cream, and marshmallows in a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan. Set over medium heat; cook, stirring, until butter and marshmallows are almost melted, about 5 to 6 minutes. Bring mixture to a boil; cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. An adult should remove the pan from the heat. Add chocolate chips and vanilla to saucepan. Stir until chips are melted and combined. If you like, mix in 1/2 cup peppermints or nuts. Pour hot fudge into the loaf pan. Top with remaining mints or nuts. Cool fudge in the pan, at room temperature, for 3 hours. Grip paper, lift out the fudge, and place on a cutting board. Discard the paper. Slice into squares or cut with a cookie cutter in desired shape. Pack it in a box lined with waxed paper to avoid sticking. The fudge will keep at room temperature for ten days in an airtight container.

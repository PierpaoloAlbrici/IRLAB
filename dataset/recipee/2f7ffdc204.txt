Olive Fougasse (Rustic Bread) -- Abm


Ingredients


 - 1 tablespoon of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 2 1/2 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 2 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 14 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 13 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

Combine the yeast, flour, sugar, salt, milk, water and olive oil in the bread machine pan and process on the dough setting. At the end of the cycle, turn out the dough onto a lightly floured board and knead in the olives. Turn the bread pan over the dough and let it rest for 15 minutes. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and roll each piece into an 8x10" rectangle. Place each rectangle on a parchment paper covered baking sheet. Make two rows of 6 to 8 evenly spaced diagonal slashes, leaving 1" at the border and in between the rows, cutting all the way through the dough. Open these slits by pulling them well apart with your hands (this traditional pattern looks like a leaf.) Coat the flatbreads with olive oil and set aside to rise until the dough is puffed, about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375F. When loaves are puffy, bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool on a rack.

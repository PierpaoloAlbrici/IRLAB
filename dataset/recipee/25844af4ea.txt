Shockingly Soft Fluffy Dough

 - 260 g of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 180 g of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 50 g of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


Instructions: 

Leave it up to the bread maker up to the first rising. Will you just barely be able to get it to gather up? Please adjust the amount of water so that it does just that. Rising complete. Let's do the finger check without leaving that up to the bread maker. If the hole closes back up after sticking in your finger, then keep an eye on it for a bit longer. This is a sticky dough, so sprinkle with lots of flour, and roll it up after separating it. Cover with a wet cloth, and let rest for 25 minutes. Mold into your desired shapes, spray with lots of mist to keep it from drying out, and let rise for the second time at 35C for 40 minutes. Bake at 180C for about 13 minutes. If you want to keep it white, then sprinkle the surface with bread flour and bake at 150C for 11 minutes. This is the ultimate secret technique! After it has cooled a bit after baking, place it into a plastic bag, let sit until it completely cools, and completely close in the moisture. I made tuna corn cheese bread with this dough.

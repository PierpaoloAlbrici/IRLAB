### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 34 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

Cream butter and all sugar. Add flour gradually, mixing with a hand-held mixer. You may need to add a small amount of water to make a smooth dough. Knead until smooth and not sticky, adding a bit more flour if required. Roll out to 1/2 inch thick and cut cookies as desired. Prick each cookie several times with a fork. Bake at 300F for 20-25 minutes, until they just start taking on some color.

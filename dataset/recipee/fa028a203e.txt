Instructions: 

Heat oven to 400F. Combine 2 cups flour and salt in bowl; cut in butter with pastry blender or fork until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in enough water with fork just until flour is moistened. Divide dough in half. Shape each half into ball; flatten slightly. Wrap 1 dough ball in plastic food wrap; refrigerate. Roll out remaining dough ball on lightly floured surface into 12-inch circle. Fold into quarters. Place dough into ungreased 9-inch pie pan; unfold, pressing firmly against bottom and sides. Trim crust to 1/2 inch from edge of pan. Combine sugar, 1/2 cup flour, cinnamon and nutmeg in bowl; mix well. Gently stir in blueberries. Spoon blueberry mixture into prepared pie crust. Roll out refrigerated dough ball on lightly floured surface into 12-inch circle. Place dough over filling. Seal, trim and crimp or flute edge. Cut 8-10 slits in crust. Cover edge of crust with 2-inch strip of aluminum foil. Bake 35 minutes; remove foil. Continue baking 10-20 minutes or until crust is lightly browned and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust. Cool pie 30 minutes; serve warm. Store refrigerated.

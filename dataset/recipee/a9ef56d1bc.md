 - 3 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 tablespoon of seeds, pumpkin and squash seeds, whole, roasted, without salt

### Instructions

Prepare a 9x13 baking pan or a cookie sheet by lining with parchment paper. You may need to tape the parchment to keep it in place. Coarsely chop the chocolate. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler, stirring frequently until completely smooth. Stir in the cinnamon and cayenne until completely incorporated. Spread chocolate out on parchment paper, using a spatula, to a thickness of about 1/2 centimeter. Sprinkle with sea salt and pepitas. Allow to harden for 12 hours (cooling in the fridge is the best option). Cut into pieces and store in a sealed container in the refrigerator.

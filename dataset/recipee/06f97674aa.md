### Ingredients

 - 34 cup of oats

 - 1 tablespoon of nuts, almonds

 - 34 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2-3 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

In a blender or food processor, combine the oats and almonds and grind to a coarse powder. Transfer to a large bowl. Add the flour and mix well. Drizzle on the oil and incorporate it with a pastry blender or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Sprinkle in enough of the water (mixing it lightly with a fork) to moisten all the flour and make a dough that you can form into a ball. Flatten the dough into a circle about 1/2-inch thick On a lightly floured board or a sheet of waxed paper, roll the dough into a thin (about 1/8 inch) circle about 11 inches diameter. Line a 9-inch pie pan with the dough and trim the edges to leave a 1/2-inch overhang all around. Use the overhang to form a fluted edge. Place the crust in the freezer for at least 20 minutes. Fill the shell and bake it according to the directions of your specific recipe. *To bake the crust without a filling; Preheat the oven to 425F. Line the prepared pie crust with aluminum foil and place it on a baking sheet. Bake for 8 minutes. Remove it from the oven and discard the foil. Bake for 7 minutes. Let the crust cool before filling.

Shortbread Cookies Just Like Panera's! Delicious!


Ingredients


 - 8 ounce of butter, without salt


 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 12 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Combine all ingredients; use hands to knead until ingredients are blended. Press into ungreased pans (or chill and roll out to about 1/2-inch on a floured board and cut into shapes). Before cooking, mark rectangle cookie lines with knife. (I even made diamonds by cutting them on a diagonal to make them look like Panera's!) Bake at 325 for about 20 minutes, or until lightly browned.

### Ingredients

 - 1 teaspoon of butter, without salt

 - 14 cup of honey

 - 14 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 14 cup of nuts, hazelnuts or filberts

 - 14 cup of nuts, pecans

 - 14 cup of seeds, sunflower seed kernels, dried

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, cardamom

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 dash of spices, cloves, ground

 - 1 cup of raisins, seeded

### Instructions

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or foil and coat with cooking spray. In a large nonstick skillet, heat butter over medium-high heat. Stir in honey and cook 2 minutes or until mixture bubbles around edges of pan. Add nuts and next 5 ingredients, and cook over medium heat until nuts are golden, about 8 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in raisins. Immediately spread onto prepared baking sheet; cool completely. Note: Mine were still a bit sticky after they cooled, so I just stored them in the refrigerator.

Filet Vampyre


Ingredients


 - 5 pound of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Heat oven to 425F. Brush beef with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper. Press so salt and pepper adhere to the meat. Place beef on a rack in a roasting pan. Tuck tail end under to ensure tenderloin roasts more evenly. Roast about 45 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers 125F. (Meat will range from medium rare to medium in different parts of the roast.)

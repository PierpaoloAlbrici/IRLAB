Maple Caramel Sauce


Ingredients


 - 1/2 pound of butter, without salt


 - 2 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of syrup, maple, canadian


Instructions: 

In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, melt butter. Add sugar and salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until sugar is completely dissolved, then adjust heat to medium and boil 2 minutes longer. Add maple syrup and boil, stirring frequently, until sauce is thick, smooth, and coats a spoon, 2 to 4 minutes longer. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Pour into heatproof decorative jars and cool completely. Refrigerate in tightly sealed jars for up to 2 months. Tie a ribbon around each jar and attach a gift tag with suggested serving ideas (for instance, "Drizzle on banana pancakes, waffles, french toast, or vanilla ice cream") and mention that sauce should be reheated before serving.

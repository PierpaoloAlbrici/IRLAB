Low Cal Fat Free Granola Base


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of oats


 - 2 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt


 - 14 cup of applesauce, canned, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid (includes usda commodity)


 - 1 tablespoon of honey


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 250F. Combine oats and cereal in large bowl. Add applesauce and stir until crumbly. Spread evenly over large baking sheet and drizzle with honey. Bake for 30 minutes, stirring twice. Increase oven temp to 350F. Add "fun" stuff: dates, raisins, nuts, etc. Note: If you like "chunky" granola, drizzle another 1 T of honey at this step and "clump" into clusters. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes until dry and golden. Cool and serve. For hot cereal, use 1:1 ratio with favorite quick cooking cereal.

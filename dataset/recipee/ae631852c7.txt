Sweet Couscous With Nuts and Dried Fruit


Ingredients


 - 2 1/3 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 13 cup of cranberries, dried, sweetened


 - 13 cup of apricots, dried, sulfured, uncooked


 - 13 cup of cherries, sweet, raw


 - 2 1/2 cup of couscous, dry


 - 12 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 12 cup of nuts, hazelnuts or filberts


 - 14 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

In a medium saucepan, combine the water, sugar, cranberries, apricots, and cherries. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes. Stir in the couscous and remove the pan from the heat. Cover the pan with a tight fitting lid until the couscous has absorbed all of the cooking liquid, about 5 to 7 minutes. Using a fork, fluff the couscous to break up any lumps. Add the almonds and hazelnuts and toss. Spread the mixture evenly on a baking sheet until completely cooled, about 10 minutes. Transfer the couscous to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator. Serving Suggestion: Drizzle the couscous with 1/4 cup of extra-virgin olive oil for a moister texture.

Breakfast (Or Dessert) Recipe


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of cereals ready-to-eat, granola, homemade


 - 2 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


 - 1 cup of grapes, red or green (european type, such as thompson seedless), raw


 - 1 cup of strawberries, raw


Instructions: 

For each serving, layer in a tall glass 1/4 c. cereal, yogurt and fruit, repeat layers. Serve or possibly cover and chill overnight to allow flavors to blend. Use ingredients according to fruit in season or possibly cereal which is available. For even fewer calories, use unflavored yogurt instead of vanilla. The mix may be combined in a large bowl, refrigerated and spooned out into small bowls at serving time. For added crunch, sprinkle each serving with bran cereal.

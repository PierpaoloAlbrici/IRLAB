### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 cup of sugars, brown

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 34 cup of syrups, corn, light

 - 2 cup of eggnog

 - 1 dash of spices, nutmeg, ground

### Instructions

Line an 8x8-inch baking pan with a double-thickness of foil; coat well with cooking spray. Place all ingredients in a heavy, deep-sided saucepan; attach a candy thermometer to the side of the saucepan. Bring mixture to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Lower heat to medium and continue cooking, stirring constantly, until mixture reaches 245 degrees F. Immediately pour caramel mixture into prepared pan; cool and refrigerate for 3 hours or more, until completely firm. Using foil, lift caramel slab from prepared pan. Pull the foil down from the sides of the caramel. Using a long knife, trim the edges off the caramel slab (these are ideal for nibbling! ), and then cut the block of caramel into 8 rows. Cut each row into 8 squares.

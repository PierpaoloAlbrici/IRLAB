Blueberry Scones


Ingredients


 - 250 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 50 g of butter, without salt


 - 25 g of sugars, powdered


 - 50 g of blueberries, raw


 - 284 ml of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Put an ungreased baking sheet into the oven and preheat oven to 230C/450F/gas8. Sift flour and baking powder together and add sugar. Add butter and rub in with fingertips until mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add blueberries and pour in the milk. Use a knife to mix everything together. (Be aware that you may not need all the buttermilk so don't add all at once). After lightly kneading (do not overknead) dough, tip onto a floured surface and pat down until approx 1inch thick. Cut out with a scone cutter or into squares with a knife. Brush the top with leftover buttermilk or normal milk and sprinkle with some sugar. Lift scones onto the preheated baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes until scones are risen and golden. Cool on a wire rack.

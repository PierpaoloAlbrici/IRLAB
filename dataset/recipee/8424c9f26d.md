### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of nuts, walnuts, english

 - 2 teaspoon of syrup, maple, canadian

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

 - 1 pinch of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350F and line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Toss the walnuts with the maple syrup, salt, and cayenne until evenly coated, then spread them evenly on the sheet pan. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes, until aromatic and slightly browned. Let cool to room temperature, then use a metal spatula to loosen the nuts. For an extra kick, add some ginger and 1/4 teaspoon of orange zest. If youd prefer a savory variation, substitute 1/4 teaspoon of olive oil for the maple syrup. If you arent a walnut fan, substitute 1/2 cup sliced almonds or pecans. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 2 weeks or in the freezer for 2 months.

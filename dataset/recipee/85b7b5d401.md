### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 13 cup of butter, without salt

 - 2-3 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 cup of cheese, gruyere

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 12 cup of onions, raw

 - 1 pound of mushrooms, white, raw

 - 1 cup of egg substitute, powder

 - 1 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

 - 3 tablespoon of tomatoes, sun-dried

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, basil, dried

### Instructions

Combine flour and butter with a pastry blender until you get a mealy texture. Add in the cold water, 1 tsp at a time until dough is able to be shaped into a ball. Be careful not to add too much or it will make it sticky. Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12 in circle, and then press into a 9 inch pie dish. Place in pie weights, and bake for 6-8 minutes at 450, or until the edges are a light brown. Turn oven down to 375. Remove the weights and sprinkle the shredded cheese along the bottom of the quiche crust. In a pan, melt 2 tbs butter and add onions and cook until they are soft. Add in the mushrooms, and saute until lightly brown. In a large bowl combine egg starters, cream, sun-dried tomatoes, and the onion and mushroom mixture. Pour into quiche crust, and sprinkle with the basil. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a knife inserted comes out clean.

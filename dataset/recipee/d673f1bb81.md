### Ingredients

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, sesame, salad or cooking

 - 1 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

 - 8 ounce of kale, raw

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk the sesame oil and soy sauce together in a large bowl until the mixture looks creamy. Add the kale and toss to coat. Lay about half of the kale out on both baking sheets in a single layer, leaving a little room between leaves. You will need to bake them in batches. Bake in the middle of the oven 6 for 7 minutes, then rotate the sheets and bake until the kale is crispy, another 6 to 7 minutes. Gently transfer it to a platter to cool. Repeat for the remaining kale. Serve once cooled.

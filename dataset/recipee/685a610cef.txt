Baked Fennel (Finocchi Al Forno) Recipe


Ingredients


 - 4 1/2 pound of fennel, bulb, raw


 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 3 1/2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Wash and trim the fennel bulbs, cutting away the stalks, base, and outer leaves. Quarter the bulbs and remove any tough core. Blanch the fennel in boiling salted water till tender, 8 to 10 min. Drain well. Preheat the oven to 400F / 200CF. Lightly oil or possibly butter a baking dish large sufficient to hold the pcs in a single layer. Place the pcs of fennel close together in the baking dish. Sprinkle with salt and grind lots of pepper on top. Spread the cheese proportionately over the fennel and drizzle with the extra virgin olive oil or possibly dot with the butter. Bake till the cheese is golden brown and the fennel juices are bubbling about 10 min. Run under the broiler if the top is not golden brown sufficient. Let stand for 10 min before serving.

### Ingredients

 - 13 cup of vinegar, cider

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, brown

 - 2 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of dill weed, fresh

 - 2 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 1 pound of carrots, raw

### Instructions

In a cup or bowl, stir together the vinegar, brown sugar, mustard, salt and dill. Set aside. In a saucepan, dry-roast the mustard seeds for about 30 seconds, until they are browned and popping. Add the vinegar mixture and bring to a boil. Stir in the carrot sticks, cover, lower the heat, and cook until tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. Stir frequently during the last few minutes of cooking. The finished carrots will be slightly caramelized. Serve hot.

### Ingredients

 - 1 gallon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 quart of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

### Instructions

Combine the milk and buttermilk in a heavy pot over low heat. Place a thermometer in the liquid, without allowing it to touch the bottom of the pan, and continue to heat until the liquid reaches 175. While the liquid is heating, rinse some cheesecloth and use it to line a strainer or small colander placed in a bowl, or line it with paper towels and it will work as well. When the ricotta forms on the surface of the milk (be patient--it may take a while), remove it with a slotted spoon or skimmer and place it in the lined strainer. Let the ricotta drain in the cheesecloth for 1 hour. Then place the lined strainer in a bowl and place in the refrigerator to let drain for a few more hours. Store in an airtight container. Ricotta is best when used in a few days.

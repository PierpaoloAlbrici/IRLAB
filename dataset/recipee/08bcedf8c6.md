[08bcedf8c6](http://www.food.com/recipe/betty-crockers-classic-chicken-broth-82385)

### Ingredients

 - 5 pound of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry

 - 3 quart of water, bottled, generic

 - 13 cup of carrots, raw

 - 13 cup of celery, raw

 - 13 cup of onions, raw

 - 1 teaspoon of parsley, fresh

 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Place in a kettle the chicken and cold water; cover and bring is slowly to boil. Remove scum and add the remaining ingredients. Cover and simmer gently for 3 hours, removing the scum occasionally. Strain, chill, remove fat, and strain again. Store in covered jars in refrigerator; the layer of fat on top will help preserve the stock, but it must be skimmed off before heating stock for use in soups and sauces. Optional, to clarify stock: for each quart, beat together 1 egg white and 1 Tbsp cold water; add with pieces of broken egg shell, stirring until stock boils; boil for 2 minutes then let stand off heat for 20 minutes; strain through double cheesecloth.

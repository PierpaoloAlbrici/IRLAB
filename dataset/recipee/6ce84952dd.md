 - 1 1/2 cup of molasses

 - 34 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 4 quart of corn, sweet, white, raw

Combine molasses and sugar in a saucepan. Grease a large mixing bowl and put in popped popcorn. Grease a mixing spoon. Set aside. Combine molasses and sugar in a saucepan. Stirring constantly, heat over medium-high heat until just about boiling. Pour over popcorn and mix well. Add peanuts if desired at this point. Let cool a little (take the kids to wash their hands - that will take just the right amount of time! ). Press popcorn into balls. (Kids love this! ). Eat what sticks on your hands.

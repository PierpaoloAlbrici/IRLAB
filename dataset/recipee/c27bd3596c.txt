 - 12 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 cup of sugars, brown


 - 12 cup of oats


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

Instructions: 

Combine all crust ingredients in a mixer and knead for 10 minutes. Place in a large bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow to ferment as long as possible (12 to 24 hours). Punch down dough now and then when you get a chance. Preheat oven to 550 degrees F. Roll the dough as thin as desired. Roll, flour, flip and repeat until you end up with a shape equal to 90% the size of your pan, as it will stretch when you transfer the dough. Place dough on pizza stone or in pan. Brush with vegetable oil and prick with fork. Pre-bake for 3 minutes. Remove from the oven and spread with cherry, blueberry or apple pie filling. If you want whole pieces of fruit with a thick topping, you will need 1 whole large can, otherwise you will need to puree half the filling if you want a thinner topping. After you have spread on the filling, you put on the crumb topping. Mix well with a fork or pastry blender. Spoon over pie filling. Use as much as you want of the topping. Put the rest in a zip-type bag in the refrigerator to save. Return pizza to the oven and continue to bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until crust is light golden brown. Remove and drizzle with Vanilla Glaze. Yields one 16-inch dessert pizza.

Grandma's Buttermilk Scones


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


Instructions: 

Sift together first 4 ingredients in a large bowl. Mix melted butter and enough buttermilk in a measuring cup to make 2 cups of liquid, dissolve baking soda in the liquid. Slowly work the liquid into the dry ingredients until a nice dough forms (you may not need all the milk so do this in stages). The dough should be easily handled and not sticky. Divide dough in half and shape into a round ball. On a lightly floured surface, roll out to 1/2" thick round and cut into pie shaped wedges (a pizza cutter works good for this). Fry in a dry electric pan at 350F (no butter/pam/oil please) until a nice golden brown. Flip and brown other side. Serve warm. (Can be reheated in a toaster). Alternatively, you can roll the doll out and use a glass to cut rounds. Grandma did that sometimes too (while I snuck behind and stole the scraps before she could roll them out again lol).

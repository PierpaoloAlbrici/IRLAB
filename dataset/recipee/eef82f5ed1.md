### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of syrup, maple, canadian

 - 1 tablespoon of syrups, corn, light

 - 3/4 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 3/4 cup of nuts, walnuts, english

### Instructions

Butter an 8x8 inch dish. In a medium saucepan, combine maple syrup, corn syrup, and cream. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Then heat without stirring to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface. Remove from heat, and let cool until lukewarm. Beat mixture until it thickens and loses its gloss. Quickly fold in vanilla and nuts, and spread in prepared pan. Let cool completely before cutting.

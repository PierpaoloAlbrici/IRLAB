Butter Toffee Crunch


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt


 - 1 cup of oil, corn, peanut, and olive


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 tablespoon of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 1 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


Instructions: 

Measure cereal and peanuts into a large bowl and set aside. Melt butter over medium high heat. Add Karo syrup and brown sugar. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Allow to boil until mixture looks foamy on top and is about double in volume; this takes about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the baking soda. Working quickly, pour the toffee mixture over the cereal and stir to coat. Spread out on a cookie sheet to cool. When cool, break into pieces and enjoy!

Browned Butter & Almond Financier


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 1/4 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 3/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 3/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 10 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 tablespoon of alcoholic beverage, distilled, rum, 80 proof


 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 cup of egg, white, raw, fresh


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


Instructions: 

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 10-inch springform pan and line the bottom with a round of parchment paper. 2. In a small saucepan set over medium heat, melt the butter. Continue to cook until it foams and darkens slightly. Pour into a small heatproof bowl and allow to cool to lukewarm. When it is cool, stir in the wine and vanilla extract. 3. Put the almonds and demerara in a food processor and pulse until finely ground. Transfer to a small bowl and whisk in the flour. 4. In a large, clean, dry bowl, whip the egg whites and salt with a hand mixer until they form very soft peaks (this could also be done with a stand mixer). With the mixer running, slowly add the remaining sugar. Continue beating until soft peaks form. 5. Alternately fold the almond and butter into the egg whites, 1/3 at a time, starting with the almond mixture and ending with the butter. 6. Pour into the prepared pan, smooth the top, and sprinkle with the sliced almonds. Bake for approximately 50 minutes, until golden and well risen and the center feels firm when pressed. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on a wire cooling rack in the pan for 5 minutes. Remove the sides and bottom of the pan and the paper and allow to cool completely on the rack. Serve with fruit and whipped cream or ice cream.

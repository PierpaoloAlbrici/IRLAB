Pizza Dough


Ingredients


 - 1 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 3 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 14 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow


Instructions: 

Place the tepid water in a mixing bowl. Dissolve the yeast and salt in the water. Add the oil, 1 1/2 cups of the weighed-out flour, and the cornmeal. Beat together for 5 to 10 minutes to form a sticky batter. Knead in the remaining flour until you have a smooth dough. Place on a clean counter and cover with the bowl. Allow to rise until double in bulk (about 1 hour). Punch the dough down and divide into 3 equal parts. To make a pizza, roll a portion of the dough on a lightly floured surface to a 14 inch diameter. Place the rolled dough on a lightly oiled pizza pan (Jeff Smith prefers Wilton). This dough recipe makes enough for three 14 inch pizzas.

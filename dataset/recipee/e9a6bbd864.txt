Pate Brisee


Ingredients


 - 1 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 14 cup of butter, without salt


 - 12 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 18 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 14 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Put flour into mixing bowl. Add butter and sugar and salt. With hands, break butter into flour. The bits of flour should remain visible as pea-size bits throughout the flour. Add enough water and knead just enough for the ingredients to hold together. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm.

Tomato Black-Pepper Granita


Ingredients


 - 2 pound of tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 teaspoon of vinegar, balsamic


Instructions: 

Quarter tomatoes and in a food processor puree with sugar until smooth. Pour puree through a sieve, pressing hard on solids, into a shallow metal baking pan. Stir in pepper and vinegar until combined well. Freeze mixture, covered, stirring and crushing lumps with a fork about every 30 minutes, until no longer slushy but not frozen solid, 2 to 3 hours. Granita may be made 2 days ahead and frozen, covered. Just before serving, scrape granita with a fork to lighten texture and break up ice crystals.

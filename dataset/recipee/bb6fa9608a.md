### Ingredients

 - 3 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 2 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cumin seed

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 3/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

Spray a large rimmed baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the almonds and the first amount of sugar and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring often, until the almonds are golden and caramelized. Transfer the almonds to a large bowl and toss with the cumin, salt, red pepper flakes and remaining sugar. Pour the almonds onto the prepared baking sheet and spread in an even layer. Let them cool for 15 minutes, until cool enough to handle. Break up the almonds into smaller pieces and store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. Adapted from Martha Stewart.

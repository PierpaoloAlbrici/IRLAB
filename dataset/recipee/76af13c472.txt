Oatmeal Shortbread


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of oats


 - 2 tablespoon of oats


 - 34 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 13 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 8 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 325. Spread oats on a rimmed baking sheet. Toast until fragrant and lightly browned, 4-6 minutes. Let cool completely. In food processor, combine flour, sugar, salt and 1/2 cup cooled oats; process until finely ground, 1 minute. Add butter. Pulse until mixture is the consistency of coarse meal. Transfer to an 8" square baking pan; press firmly into bottom. Sprinkle remaining oats on top and press gently. Bake until firm and lightly browned, 30-35 minutes. Using a paring knife, immediately score shortbread into 16 squares; then score each square diagonally into 2 trianges. On a wire rack, cool completely in pan; gently invert and break along scored lines.

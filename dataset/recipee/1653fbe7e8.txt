Cooked Radishes are Yummy!


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of radishes, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 14 cup of sugars, brown


 - 12 cup of parsley, fresh


 - 12 teaspoon of dill weed, fresh


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Bring 1 cup water to a boil with the 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium saucepan. Add prepared radishes, cover and simmer till radishes pierce easily with a toothpick (10 minutes). Drain water. Add margarine and brown sugar and toss to form a glaze. Add parsley and/or dill and serve. The violet color glistens in the butter glaze and the taste is exceptional. Serves 4-6 as a side dish.

Festive Chewy Cherry Cookies


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 34 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 12 cup of sugars, brown


 - 2 tablespoon of cherries, sweet, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 2 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of cherries, sweet, raw


 - 1 1/4 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


Instructions: 

Cream butter and sugar together until fluffy, then blend in juice from drained cherries and extract. Mix in flour until combined then stir in coconut and cherries. Shape the dough into rolls in plastic wrap(this will be very sticky!) and place in fridge for a few hours until firm (or freeze until needed). Preheat oven to 380F remove from fridge and slice into rounds and place on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for about 10-12 minutes. I did mine convection at 360 for about 10 minutes also. Bake until edges are slightly brown.

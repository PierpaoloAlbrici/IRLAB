Ina Gartens Homemade Gravy


Ingredients


 - 14 pound of butter, without salt


 - 1 1/2 cup of onions, raw


 - 14 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 2 cup of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry


 - 1 tablespoon of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


Instructions: 

In a large (10 to 12-inch) saute pan, cook the butter and onions over medium-low heat for 12 to 15 minutes, until the onions are lightly browned. Dont rush this step; it makes all the difference when the onions are well-cooked. Sprinkle the flour into the pan, whisk in, then add the salt and pepper. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the hot chicken stock mixture and Cognac, and cook uncovered for 4 to 5 minutes until thickened. Add the wine and cream, if desired. Season, to taste, and serve.

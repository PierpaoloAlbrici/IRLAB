### Ingredients

 - 3/4 cup of oats

 - 3/4 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1 cup of beverages, protein powder whey based

 - 2 tablespoon of nuts, almonds

 - 1/4 cup of beverages, almond milk, unsweetened, shelf stable

 - 1 tablespoon of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 1 tablespoon of cherries, sweet, raw

 - 1 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

### Instructions

Note the cook time is actually chill time. Mix the oats, rice crisp cereal, cinnamon and protein powder together in a medium sized bowl. Stir in the almond butter and milk until there are no more dry chunks of anything, then add the chocolate chunks and cherries. Place dough on a sheet of wax paper and stick it in the refrigerator to chill for about a half an hour (optional, but makes the dough easier to work with). Roll the dough into eight equal-sized balls. Getting your hands slightly wet beforehand makes it slightly easier to work with. Alternatively, you could form them into bigger protein barsthis recipe would make about 5 decent sized bars. Next, melt the dark chocolate in the microwave (heat for 30 second bursts and stir between, continuing until melted) or in a saucepan over very low heat, being careful not to burn it. Dunk the protein bites into the chocolate, then place back onto the wax paper. Let them cool in the fridge for 30-60 minutes, then eat up!

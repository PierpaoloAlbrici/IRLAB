### Ingredients

 - 14 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 14 cup of cream, sour, cultured

 - 14 cup of jams and preserves, apricot

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 2 tablespoon of peppers, sweet, green, raw

### Instructions

In a small mixing bowl, beat cream cheese and sour cream with an electric mixer until well blended. Spoon mixture into a small bowl lined with plastic wrap or a 6-ounce ramekin. Press mixture slightly to get rid of any air pockets; smooth evenly with rubber scraper. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to firm slightly. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat fruit spread and red pepper flakes over medium heat until spread just begins to melt, about 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and stir in bell pepper. Let cool to room temperature. To serve, if using bowl, invert mixture onto a serving plate, remove plastic wrap, and spoon apricot mixture on top. If using ramekin, top cream cheese mixture with apricot mixture.

Honey Chili Chicken Wings


Ingredients


 - 2 pound of chicken, broilers or fryers, wing, meat and skin, raw


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, chili powder


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, onion powder


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cumin seed


 - 1/2 cup of honey


 - 1 tablespoon of vinegar, cider


Instructions: 

Remove chicken from package and rinse well. Pat dry and place on a foil-lined baking sheet. (This will help with cleanup.) For the dry rub: In a small bowl, combine the garlic powder, chili powder, onion powder, salt and cumin. Stir well to combine. Sprinkle about half over the chicken wings and rub into the skin. Flip wings over and repeat on the other side. Let sit about 5 minutes. For the glaze: Put honey into a microwave safe container and heat for about 10 seconds. Remove from microwave and stir in apple cider vinegar. Grill wings about 7 minutes on each side. During the last 2 to 3 minutes of cooking, spread glaze on wings (both sides) with a basting brush.

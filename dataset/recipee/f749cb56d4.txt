Instructions: 

The mold shapes used were bats, witches, gravestones, ghosts and skulls. You can use any molds to make chocolate lollipops. To make the lollipop: Pour any of the tempered chocolates directly into the molds, filling them to the top. Tap the molds against the work surface to release the air bubbles. Set the sticks in place by inserting them just far enough to be secure within the mold you are using. Set the molds aside to allow the chocolate to set. When set, simply pop out the lollipops. If you do not have any lollipop molds, you can use Play-Doh modeling clay to make your own molds. Roll fresh Play-Doh into a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle on top of a sheet of parchment paper. Use a sharp paring knife to cut shapes from the Play-Doh. Remove the cutout leaving the homemade mold. Spray the inside edge of the Play-Doh with vegetable cooking spray. Pour the chocolate into the cutout space. Insert the lollipop sticks and let cool completely before removing the Play-Doh. When finished, the Play-Doh can be saved and reused for another day.

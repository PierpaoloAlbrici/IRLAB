Roasted Pumpkin Seeds and Pumpkin


Ingredients


 - 1 quart of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 2 cup of seeds, pumpkin and squash seeds, whole, roasted, without salt


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Cut pumpkin in half and scoop out seeds. Place cut pumpkin side down on baking dish (which you have added enough water to cover pan 1/4 inch). Place in 350 degree oven and bake until pumpkin is soft. Remove from oven and scoop pumpkin out of skin. Freeze for later use. For the seeds: Preheat oven to 250. Pick through seeds and remove any cut seeds. Remove as much of the stringy fibers as possible. Bring the water and salt to a boil. Add the seeds and boil for 10 minutes. Drain and spread on a kitchen towel and pat dry. Place the seeds in a bowl and toss with melted butter. Spread evenly on a large cookie sheet or roasting pan. Place pan in a preheated oven and roast the seeds for 30 to 40 minutes. Stir every 10 minutes, until crisp and golden brown. Cool the seeds, then shell and eat or pack in airtight containers and refrigerate until ready to eat (let's get real -- these puppies will be gone before they make it to the refrigerator).

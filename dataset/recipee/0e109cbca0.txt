Poached Eggs in an Onion Ring.


Ingredients


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Heat your skillet to medium high heat, cut your onion into large flat sided rings. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil and place an onion ring in the center of the pan, flatten it as best you can with a spatula. While holding the onion ring firmly against the pan crack an egg inside of the ring and cover. Pour a tablespoon of water into the pan and re-cover to allow the steam to cook the top of the eggs. Season to your liking and enjoy!

### Ingredients

 - 6 cup of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

### Instructions

Pop the popcorn and put it into a bowl. Make sure there is some extra room in the bowl if possibble. You'll need that room when you toss the popcorn. In a small microwave safe bowl, microwave together the butter and honey, only until melted. Over heat it, and it WILL burn (trust me, I've done it. ). Using a regular spoon, drizzle 2 spoonfuls of the butter/honey mixture over the popcorn and toss thoroughly. THIS IS CRUCIAL. Put any more on at once and it won't turn out right. Repeat step three. Most of the mixture will be gone before it seems like you're getting anywhere with this. Be patient, and when the honey/butter is all gone, enjoy:).

### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of mushrooms, white, raw

 - 14 cup of delallo, italian seasoned breadcrumbs, upc: 072368104621

 - 12 cup of cream, sour, cultured

 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 14 cup of onions, raw

### Instructions

In a heavy 10-12 inch stainless-steel or enamel skillet, melt 4 Tblsp. butter over moderate heat. When the foam subsides, add the chopped onions and cook 3 to 5 minutes, or until the onions are soft and transparent but not brown. Now add the mushroom slices and cook another 3 to 5 minutes. Shake the pan from time to time so that the mushrooms do not stick. When the mushrooms are a light, delicate brown, sprinkle in the bread crumbs and toss the contents of the pan gently with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Remove the pan from the heat. In a small bowl, beat the sour cream with a wooden spoon or whisk for a minute or two, then stir it into the skillet. Toss lightly until the mushrooms are well coated with the cream. Serve as a vegetable accompaniment to meat or fish dishes.

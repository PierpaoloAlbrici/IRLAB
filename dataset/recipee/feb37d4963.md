[feb37d4963](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/desserts/peanut-butter-cups-3/)

### Ingredients

 - 1/2 pound of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 1 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

 - 1/4 pound of sugars, powdered

### Instructions

Temper the chocolate (see the note in the short description). This can be done by hand, or with a tempering unit. The tempering unit is MUCH easier. With a hand mixer, beat peanut butter and powdered sugar together, until combined and fluffy. You can use foil cupcake wrappers, or silicone, of any size. (I have a grande size featured in the picture.) Fill wrappers 1/2 way with chocolate. Using a brush (or fingers), make sure the sides of the cupcake wrappers are completely covered with chocolate. Pipe in peanut butter mixture, filling cups 2/3 full. Cover with tempered chocolate, making sure to cover all the peanut butter. Refrigerate for 25 minutes. Enjoy!

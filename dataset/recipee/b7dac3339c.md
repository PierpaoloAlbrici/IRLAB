Spread half the ground nuts in a thin, even layer over the bottom of a large ungreased baking sheet. Spread half the chocolate over the nuts. Combine sugar, butter, corn syrup, chopped walnuts and water in a heavy saucepan; place over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until a candy thermometer reads 280 degrees. Remove from heat, allow to stand a few minutes longer until thermometer reads 285 degrees. Pour the hot mixture over the nut and chocolate layers. Allow to cool for 10 minutes. Sprinkle remaining chocolate evenly over the cooling syrup, then sprinkle on the remaining ground nuts. Let stand in a cool place (preferably not the kitchen) for at least five hours. Break or cut into bite-size pieces. If the chocolate has not hardened thoroughly, place the candies in the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes. Store in a covered container or in glass jars or decorated tins.

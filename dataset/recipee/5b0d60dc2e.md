### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of squash, winter, butternut, raw

 - 13 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Cut the top of the butternut squash where the stem is at. Then cut it horizontally in the middle to separate the long part from the round base. Set the base aside and save it for another recipe. With a peeler, begin to peel the skin off the squash. Once that is done, throw away the skin and make sure your surface is cleaned. Grab a mandoline slicer and slice the squash to create potato-chip-like shapes. Then spread the squash on top of a nonstick baking dish. Drizzle them with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Place them in a preheated 400 degrees F oven for 35 minutes. For a burnt crispier outcome, leave them in for another 5 minutes. Once they are done cooking, remove and let them cool. Then serve and enjoy!

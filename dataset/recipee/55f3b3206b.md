### Ingredients

 - 1 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground

 - 14 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 5 7/8 ounce of lard

 - 13 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 tablespoon of rice vinegar, upc: 4979435030332

### Instructions

In a large bowl with a pastry blender or two knives, cut lard into flour and salt until particles are the size of small peas. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1/4 cup flour, the water and the vinegar, whisk until smooth. Pour all at once into lard/flour mixture; stir with a fork just until the ingredients are combined. Divide dough in half, wrap each in plastic wrap and chill a minimum of 2 hours, preferably overnight (I tried skipping this once - don't! ). Roll out and bake as your recipe directs.

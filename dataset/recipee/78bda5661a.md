### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Mix flour and baking powder together. Add milk and peanut butter. Mix well. Roll out 1/4 inch thick and cut into desired shape. Place on greased cookie sheet and bake 20 minute. Store in ziplock bag. I didn't roll mine out, I just took spoons full and flattened in my palms. I am just guessing at how many this made. I guess it depends on how big you make them.

### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of sweet potato, raw, unprepared

 - 14 cup of butter, without salt

 - 14 cup of sugars, brown

 - 2 tablespoon of orange juice, raw

 - 12 cup of pineapple, raw, all varieties

 - 1 pinch of spices, cinnamon, ground

### Instructions

Wash the sweet potatoes, but do not peel. Boil them in a large pan of salted water until just tender, for about 30-45 minutes depending on their size. Remove from the heat and drain well. Cool slightly, then peel. Preheat the oven to 400. Thickly slice the sweet potatoes and arrange in a single overlapping layer in a greased ovenproof dish. Cut the butter into small cubes and dot them over the top. Sprinkle with the sugar, maple syrup or honey and the fruit juice. Add the pineapple and spices, if using. Bake for 30-40 minutes, basting occasionally, until golden brown.

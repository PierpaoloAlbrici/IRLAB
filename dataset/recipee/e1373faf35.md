[e1373faf35](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/148092-basic-scones)

### Ingredients

 - 200 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched

 - 30 g of sugars, granulated

 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 50 g of butter, without salt

 - 100 ml of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

### Instructions

Sift together the flour and baking powder. Add the ingredients to a bowl. Mix them together lightly and then add the butter, cut into small cubes. Rub the mixture together with your fingertips until you get something that looks like panko. Make a well in the center of the panko and pour in the milk and vegetable oil. Fold the wet ingredients in with a spatula. Dust a work surface with flour and roll the dough out until just over 1 cm thick. Fold the dough in half and press it down gently. Then use some cutters to cut out some shapes. Preheat the oven to 200C. Lightly brush the tops of the scones with milk and leave them to sit in a warm place for 15 minutes. Then bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes. The scones in the recipe photo have been served with clotted cream and strawberry jam. I'm also fond of adding tea leaves into the mixture at Step 2 (I recommend Earl Grey.) These "Mixed Herbs & Seeds Scones",, go really well with cream cheese "Cheddar, Dill & Red Onion Scones",.

'V' Scottish Cranachan


Ingredients


 - 2 ounce of oats


 - 250 g of raspberries, raw


 - 1 pint of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 3 tablespoon of alcoholic beverage, distilled, whiskey, 86 proof


 - 1 tablespoon of honey


Instructions: 

Heat a large heavy based skillet/frying pan on the stove until hot. Add the oats and stirring constantly , toast the oats until they have a light, nutty smell and are just beginning to change colour. Do not leave them as they the oatmeal can quickly burn. Remove the oats from the pan. keep a handful of raspberries to one side, place the remaining raspberries into a food processor and whiz once or twice to create a puree, don't whiz too much I just crushed them with a fork preferred it more solid than pureed ...you can add sugar or powdered sweetener at this point as raspberries are a bit tart In a large bowl whisk the cream and whiskey to form stiff peaks, finally fold in the honey. in either a glass trifle bowl, or individual dessert glasses layer the dessert starting with the cream , followed by raspberries then oatmeal, repeat several times always finish with a layer of cream then a scattering of oatmeal ..then place remaining raspberries on top if desired ....or just eat them mmm. cover the bowl with clingfilm and chill for 1 hour or more if possible. Drizzle over a little extra honey ( optional) can be served with shortbread perfect for any celebrations...Hogmanay, or. Burns night supper ..also good in the summer

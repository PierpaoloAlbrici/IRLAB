Grilled Shrimp


Ingredients


 - 2 pound of crustaceans, shrimp, raw (not previously frozen)


 - 34 cup of butter, without salt


 - 14 cup of lime juice, raw


Instructions: 

Peel and devein shrimp (or have your seafood guy do it for you). Combine butter and lime juice. Dip shrimp in butter mixture, and thread tail and neck of each shrimp on skewers so shrimp will lie flat,(soak skewers in water ahead of time, so they dont burn). Grill over medium hot coals 3-4 minutes on each side, or until pink. Serve butter mixture with shrimp.

Overnight Soaked Oatmeal


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of oats


 - 1 cup of raisins, seeded


 - 4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 4 tablespoon of vinegar, cider


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of apples, raw, with skin


Instructions: 

In a large pan, combine oats, raisins, half of the water and the apple cider vinegar. Soak overnight or at least 8 hours. In the morning add remaining half of the water, oil/butter and the salt. Put pan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil (try not to stir too much or it will get mushy). When it starts to boil, reduce heat to a simmer and cook (while stirring occasionally) for 7-8 minutes. When it starts to thicken, add chopped apples, turn heat off and cover with a lid. Let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes before serving. Note: If the vinegar scares you a bit, use 1/2 vinegar and 1/2 lemon juice!

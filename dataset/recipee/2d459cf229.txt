Buttermilk Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 34 teaspoon of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 34 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

In a medium mixing bowl combine flour, baking powder, sugar, salt and cream of tartar. Using pastry blender or fingers, cut in cold butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center of dry mixture. Add buttermilk all at once to dry mixture. (May have to add an extra 1 to 3 tablespoons of buttermilk if it seems dry). Using a fork, stir just until moistened. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Knead dough 6 times by folding and gently pressing. Lightly pat dough to 3/4 inch thickness. Cut dough with a floured 3 inch biscuit cutter. Place biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake 450 degree F. oven for 9 to 12 minutes or until tops are lightly golden.

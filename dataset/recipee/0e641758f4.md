### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of nuts, cashew nuts, raw

 - 13 cup of bananas, raw

 - 1 teaspoon of honey

 - 13 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1/4 teaspoon of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

 - 1/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 4 teaspoon of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

### Instructions

Combine cashews and banana chips in food processor for 8-10 minutes until nut butter consistency is reached, scraping down the sides as necessary. Add in honey, vanilla extract, cream of tartar, and baking soda and process until combined. Add in coconut oil, 1 teaspoon at a time, until desired consistency is reached. I added in about 4 teaspoons. This amount got me a thicker nut butter that had a cookie dough-like consistency, but feel free to add more. Yields about a cup of sugar cookie butter. Lasts for up to 1 week at room temperature in an airtight container.

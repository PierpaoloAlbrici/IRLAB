Potatoes-canning Recipe


Ingredients


 - 3 pound of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 5 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Leave smal potatoes whole, cut large potatoes into quarters. In a large saucepan add potatoes and enough water to cover. Cover pot and bring to a boil. Boil for 10 minutes. Drain potatoes. Pack hot potatoes into a hot sterile quart jar. Add salt if using. Ladle boiling water over potatoes-leave 1 inch head space. Remove air bubbles. Wipe rims and adjust 2 piece caps. Process quarts 40 minutes at 10 pounds pressure in a steam-pressure canner. This recipe is for a single quart-you can make as many as you wish. If you prefer pints use 1/2 t salt per pint and process 35 minutes at 10 pounds pressure in a steam-pressure canner. Adjust times for your altitude.

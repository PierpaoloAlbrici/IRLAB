### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Heat a skillet over high heat. Dredge scallops in spices and saute/fry on both sides. Finish the cooking in the oven, for about 4 or possibly 5 min. It is also wise to have all your windows open, and all your smoke alarms disconnected, considering the amount of smoke which this wonderful dish produces. This recipe yields 4 servings.

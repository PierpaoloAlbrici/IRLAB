Reduced Balsamic Vinegar


Ingredients


 - 16 ounce of vinegar, balsamic


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


Instructions: 

In a heavy gauged saucepan, whisk all the ingredients and bring to boil over medium high heat. Then, turn down heat until you get a rapid simmer. Whisk every now and again and keep an eye on it. In about 15-20 minutes it will start to get all syrupy and resinous-looking. Dont let it get too thick on the stove because once you let it cool, it will thicken more. Take it off the heat when it starts to look like the consistency of warm honey. I keep mine in a small mason jelly jar ready to drizzle on strawberries, pizza, cheese, etc. !

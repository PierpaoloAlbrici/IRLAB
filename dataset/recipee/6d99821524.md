[6d99821524](http://www.food.com/recipe/welsh-toffee-cyflaith-194861)

### Ingredients

 - 8 cup of sugars, brown

 - 23 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 3 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 16 tablespoon of butter, salted

### Instructions

Using an enameled or stainless steel saucepan over low heat, gradually dissolve the sugar in the boiling water. Stir it continuously with a wooden spoon until the sugar is thoroughly dissolved. This usually takes from 20 to 30 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat, add the lemon juice and the softened butter, and stir them into the sugar. Boil this mixture fairly briskly, WITHOUT STIRRING it, for 15 minutes. Gently drop a teaspoonful of the mixture into a cupful of cold water; if it hardens at once, it has reached the required consistency (soft-crack stage). Pour the mixture slowly onto a buttered marble slab or large flat dish. Do not scrape the saucepan clean as the scraping might turn the toffee back into sugar. Use extra butter to butter your hands. Pull the taffy into long golden strands while it is still hot. Cut the taffy in smaller pieces. To make about 3 pounds. Welsh Fare S. Minwel Tibbott.

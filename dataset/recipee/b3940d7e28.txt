Grilled Lemonade Wings


Ingredients


 - 2-3 pound of chicken, broilers or fryers, wing, meat and skin, raw


 - 14 cup of lemonade, frozen concentrate, white, prepared with water


 - 14 cup of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 3 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


 - 2 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, thyme, dried


Instructions: 

Place wings in a large plastic zipper bag. Mix together marinade ingredients until well blended. Add all but 1/2 cup marinade to the wings in the bag; reserve 1/2 cup marinade separately in the refrigerator to use for basting the wings while cooking. Seal bag, turn to coat the wings and refrigerate for 3 to 5 hours, turning wings occasionally. Place wings on grate of medium-hot grill, discard marinade in ziplock bag. Cover grill and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, turning wings and brushing with the reserved marinade every 5 or 10 minutes. Wings should be nicely browned and cooked through. If wings are getting too browned before they are cooked through, move to cooler area of grill and continue cooking.

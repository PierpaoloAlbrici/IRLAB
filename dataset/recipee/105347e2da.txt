Summer Berry Gelatin Salad


Ingredients


 - 6 ounce of strawberries, raw


 - 2 cup of cranberry juice, unsweetened


 - 1 cup of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 cup of blueberries, raw


 - 1 cup of raspberries, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 1 cup of strawberries, raw


Instructions: 

In a medium sized bowl, dissolve gelatin in the boiling cranberry juice. Let the mixture cool for 10 minutes. Stir in club soda and lemon juice; refrigerate for 45 minutes or until partially set. To quicken the setting process, carefully put the bowl containing the gelatin mixture in a larger bowl of ice water and stir occasionally for about 10-15 minutes. Fold in berries. Pour into a 6-cup ring mold that youve coated with cooking spray or use several miniature molds. Refrigerate for 4 hours or until set. Unmold onto a pretty platter. Garnish with additional berries and serve. Recipe was a collaboration with and was used with permission from Miss Sophie.

Lower Carb Pizza Dough (Two 14


Ingredients


 - 1 1/3 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1 1/2 cup of vital wheat gluten


 - 12 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

In a large bowl add salt, sugar, olive oil, and optional garlic powder to the warm water. Add Bread Flour and Yeast and stir until combined. Add Vital Wheat Gluten and combine as much as possible. Turn mixture out on a well floured surface and scrape any unincorporated ingredients from the bowl on top of the mixture. Knead 1/4 turn at a time with your palm until the mixture is no longer sticky and is very elastic-- this usually takes about 3-5 minutes and 1/2 cup flour. Note that the amount of additional flour required will depend on how much humidity your ingredients have absorbed-- You may need more or less than 1/2 cup. Put 1 Tbs of olive oil in your large bowl then swirl it around the bottom and half way up the sides. Put the dough in the bowl, then turn it over, cover and let it rise in a warm place. After it doubles, punch it down, turn it over, cover, and let it rise again. Cut the dough in half and place in freezer bags-- if using immediately, place half the dough on prepared pizza pan without punching it down so that it will be easier to spread out. To use frozen dough, let it thaw in the freezer bag then place in a bowl, cover, and allow it to rise in a warm place before placing on a pizza pan prepared with cooking spray. Since this dough is very elastic, I spread it out with my fingers as much as possible, then let it rise a little and spread it some more-- this seems easier than rolling it. Prick the dough with a fork to avoid bubbles, add your favorite sauce, pizza ingredients and cheese. Bake in a hot oven, 450F, until the cheese and the edge of the crust are lightly browned and cut the pizza into slices. Notes: The "cooking" time is an estimate of time for rising; The nutritional information is for one slice of pizza crust assuming that each pizza is sliced into 8 pieces.

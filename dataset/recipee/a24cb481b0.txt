Peanut Butter Granola


Ingredients


 - 2 tablespoon of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


 - 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of oats


 - 2 tablespoon of nuts, walnuts, english


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Spray a small baking dish with non-stick cooking spray. In a medium microwave-safe bowl, microwave the peanut butter and honey for 15 seconds. Stir well. Add vanilla, cinnamon and salt and mix well. Stir in the oats and nuts (if using), and mix until covered with the peanut butter mixture. Spread the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet and bake for 18-20 minutes. Your nose will let you know when the granola is done. It will begin to turn golden brown. Remove from the oven and let sit in the baking dish for about 10 minutes to allow the granola to become crispy. Serve with fresh fruit, yogurt, nuts, etc. I like to separate this into four separate containers so that its ready to go throughout the week and is portion-controlled!

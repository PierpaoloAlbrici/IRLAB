[7e79305200](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/arroz-con-coco-385835)

### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1/3 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 1/2 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

 - 1/2 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

### Instructions

Combine the coconut milk and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently, and cook until the mixture darkens in color, 5 to 10 minutes. Add the rice and salt, then cover; adjust the heat so the mixture simmers gently. Cook until all the liquid is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes; let stand for about 10 minutes before serving. During that time, if you like, toast the coconut in a dry skillet, shaking occasionally, until lightly browned. Stir into the rice just before serving.

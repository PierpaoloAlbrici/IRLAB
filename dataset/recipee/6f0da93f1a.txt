Honey Chive Codfish


Ingredients


 - 1 teaspoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 pound of fish, cod, atlantic, raw


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 13 cup of soup, chicken broth or bouillon, dry


 - 1 teaspoon of cornstarch


 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


 - 18 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

Instructions: 

Spray a large skillet with nonstick spray, add butter and melt over medium-high heat. Season cod with a little salt and add to the pan and cook 4-5 minutes, or until golden brown. Carefully flip fish over using a wide spatula. Add water to the pan along the sides (not on top of the fish). Lower heat to medium or medium-low, cover, and cook another 4-6 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork (do not overcook or it will get tough). Meanwhile, in a small pan, combine chicken broth & cornstarch with a whisk until smooth; set the heat to medium-high. Add lemon juice, honey, and pepper, whisking and cooking until thickened and clear, whisking the whole time. Add chives to the sauce and stir quickly. Serve fish with honey chives sauce ladled over each portion.

### Ingredients

 - 3/4 cup of shortening, vegetable, household, composite

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 teaspoon of vinegar, distilled

 - 1/2 cup of molasses

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

Beat shortening until fluffy. Add sugar and continue to beat until well combined. Add the rest of the ingredients in order, beating well after each addition. When the ingredients are well mixed, wrap the mixture in waxed paper and refrigerate for 1 hour to make the dough easier to handle. On a floured board, roll out the dough until it is about an 18 inch thick. Using a cookie cutter, cut into cookies and place on a cookie sheet. Bake 8 to 10 minutes at 275F (140C). Cool for a couple of minutes on the sheet and then remove to a wire rack to cool.

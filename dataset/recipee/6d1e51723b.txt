Instructions: 

For the shortbread cookies: Preheat the oven to 300 F degrees. Cream the butter with the sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer. In a small bowl, whisk the salt and flour, and then add into the butter, 1/4 cup at a time, just until uniform. Do not overmix. Gather the dough into a ball, refrigerate for 15 minutes if the dough is beginning to soften or feel too greasy to work with. Roll the dough out to 1/2-inch and cut into rectangles about 1/2-inch by 2 - inch. Arrange on a cold, ungreased baking sheet. Bake until the edges are just beginning to turn golden, 19 to 21 minutes. Make 16 shortbread cookies. Meanwhile, to make the fruit and nut topping: In a small bowl, combine together the pecans, dried fruits, and chocolate chips with the orange marmalade. After baking for about 20 minutes, remove the cookies from the oven and spread the fruit and nut topping on the tops of the shortbread to make bars. Return to the oven and bake for 8 more minutes. Let cool enough to handle before serving. Best result will be within two days or freeze for later use.

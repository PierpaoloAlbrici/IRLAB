In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat. Saute the chicken and mushrooms for 5-6 minutes, or until no pink remains in the chicken. Remove the chicken and mushrooms from the skillet; discard the pan juices. Add the remaining butter, flour, salt, and pepper to the skillet; cook, whisking constantly, until the butter melts.

Reduce the heat to medium-low, return the chicken and mushrooms to the skillet; add the peas and pimientos. Simmer until heated through, stirring constantly. Serve immediately.

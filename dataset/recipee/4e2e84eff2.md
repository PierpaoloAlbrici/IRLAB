### Ingredients

 - 6 ounce of cranberries, dried, sweetened

 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 24 ounce of apple juice, canned or bottled, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid

### Instructions

In a food processor, pulse the cranberries and sugar until they are broken up but not complete mush. Add cranberries and sugar to a small sauce pan and heat over medium heat stirring constantly until the sugar is dissolved, about 3-4 minutes. In a shallow baking dish add the bottle of sparkling juice and the cranberries, stir to combine. Place in the freezer and every 45 minutes scrape the surface of the mixture with a fork. After about 3 hours it will be totally frozen and if you have done your job with the fork it will be nice and fluffy. Store the granita in an airtight container after it has completely set.

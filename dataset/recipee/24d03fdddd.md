[24d03fdddd](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/144982-ciabatta-the-italian-dinner-roll)

### Ingredients

 - 100 g of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 100 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 4 g of salt, table

 - 2 g of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 130 ml of water, bottled, generic

 - 15 ml of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Combine the ingredients in a bowl. When they are all combined, drizzle in the olive oil and mix some more. Mix with a rubber spatula until the flour has been well incorporated, then form into a single roll of dough and knead. Let the dough rise until it doubles in size. It might turn out better if you let it rise over a long time in a low-temperature environment. You can use a bread machine up until this point. Punch out the dough after it has risen, then let it rest for 20 minutes. Fold the dough into thirds and form it into a round shape. Use a dough scraper to cut it into four pieces and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place a tightly wrung out cloth over the dough to keep it from drying, and let them rise for about 60 minutes at room temperature. Use a tea strainer to dust the dough with some bread flour (not listed) and bake in an oven that has been preheated to 200C for 5 minutes, then lower the temperature to 180C and bake for 10 more minutes. I made paninis with them. Use this recipe if you want a more authentic version!

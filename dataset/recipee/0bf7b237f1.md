[0bf7b237f1](http://www.food.com/recipe/brown-rice-parboiled-2-qt-pressure-cooker-513599)

### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

### Instructions

In pressure cooker, pour in water and bring it to a rolling boil. Pour in well-drained rice, stir well. Secure lid, and bring to LOW pressure (8 psi, 1 bar). Once pot has reached low pressure, adjust heat to stabilize at low pressure. (My stove runs hot for a simmer, so sometimes I stack an extra burner grate or I press the steam valve of my Kuhn Rikon p.c. lid with a wooden spoon to keep the pressure at 1 bar.) Once low pressure has been reached, begin timing for 6 minutes and cook for 6 minutes. Remove from heat. Let pressure reduce naturally (this will absorb some of the excess water, if any). Remove lid and serve.

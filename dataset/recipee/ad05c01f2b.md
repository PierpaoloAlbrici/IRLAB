### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow

 - 1 cup of okra, raw

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 14 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 3 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Clean and wash okra. Dice all but 6. Add 3 cups of water to a large saucepan. Add salt. Add diced and whole okra. Bring okra to boil for 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat. Save whole okra aside for garnish. Measure 2 cups of liquid from the cooked okra to use for cooking your cou-cou. Mix cornmeal in a large bowl with enough cold water to moisten and blend it together. Stir the cornmeal slowly into the reserved liquid and okra. Use a wooden spoon to mix together. Return pot to stove over medium heat, and continue stirring okra and cornmeal. Cook and stir about 15-20 minutes. Insert wooden spoon into center of the cou-cou If spoon stands up in the pot and is easily removed from cornmeal, your cou-cou is done. Cou-cou should be firm when it's done. If the cou-cou is oose and creamy looking, you have used too much water. If too much water is used, let cou-cou stand uncovered over low heat to "dry out." When cou-cou is done, turn the entire mixture into a buttered serving bowl and garnish with whole okra.

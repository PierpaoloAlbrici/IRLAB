### Ingredients

 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 11 ounce of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

 - 8 ounce of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022

 - 1 1/4 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place butter and 1/3 of the coconut in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Process until mixture forms a ball, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Sprinkle remaining coconut over mixture, and combine with your fingers. Place an 8" tart parn with a removeable bottom on a baking sheet. Press coconut mixture into bottom and up sides of pan to form a crust, leaving top edges loose and fluffy. Place a ring of aluminum foil over edge to prevent burning. Bake until center begins to brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove foil, and cook until edges are browned, 4 to 6 minutes more. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Place chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring cream just to a boil in a small saucepan, and pour over chocolate. Let sit 10 minutes, and stir until chocolate is melted and combined. Let cool, and pour into coconut crust. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until filling is set, at least 1 hour. Cut into wedges and serve.

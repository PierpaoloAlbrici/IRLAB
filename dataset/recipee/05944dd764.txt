Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate Chocolate Frosting


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 23 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


 - 3 cup of sugars, powdered


 - 13 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Melt butter. Stir in cocoa. Alternately add powdered sugar and milk, beating to spreading consistency. Add a small amount of additional milk, if needed. Stir in vanilla. Tip: If the frosting is too thin to spread or pipe, you can put it in the refrigerator to thicken for a little bit, take it out, and then stir so it becomes creamy again.

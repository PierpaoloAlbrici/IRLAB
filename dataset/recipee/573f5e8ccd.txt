Shortbread Jammers


Ingredients


 - 1/2 pound of butter, without salt


 - 3/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 13 cup of rice flour, white, unenriched


 - 1 cup of jams and preserves, apricot


Instructions: 

Heat oven to 325 degrees. Lightly butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. In the bowl of a standing mixer (or in a large bowl if using a hand mixer), beat the butter and sugar at medium speed for about 3 minutes. Add the salt and vanilla and continue to beat until well combined. Add the flours and continue to beat until the dough comes together. Press the dough evenly into the prepared pan, smoothing the surface. Prick it with a fork in about 20 places. Bake for 35 minutes, or until golden around the edges. Slide a dull knife along the edges. Cool for 5 minutes. Carefully turn the slab of shortbread out onto a clean surface. With a knife, trim 1 inch from one of the long sides. Crumble the trimmings into a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Cut the rest of the shortbread into 24 squares and allow to cool. Spread a thick layer of jam on each square, and then sprinkle with the crumbs. Layered between plastic wrap or wax paper in an airtight container, the cookies will keep for 3 to 4 days.

### Ingredients

 - 2 pound of potatoes, raw, skin

 - 4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1/4 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Using a mandolin or very sharp, heavy knife, slice the potatoes into rounds as thin as possible, and place in a large bowl of water to prevent discoloration. Heat the oil in a large, heavy pot to between 340 and 350 degrees F. Pat the potatoes completely dry. Add to the oil in batches and cook until golden brown, stirring with a long handled spoon to turn and cook evenly, about 2 minutes. Drain on paper towels and place in a large bowl. Toss with the cheese, truffle oil, salt, and pepper. Serve immediately.

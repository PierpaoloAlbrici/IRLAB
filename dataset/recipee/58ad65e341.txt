Mustard Roasted Potatoes


Ingredients


 - 13 cup of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 2-3 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 1/2 pound of potatoes, raw, skin


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the mustard and olive oil. Add the potatoes and toss to coat. Dump the potatoes onto a foil lined large rimmed baking sheet and spread them in a single layer. Roast, tossing with a spatula a few times, until the potatoes are crusty on the outside and tender throughout, about an hour. Serve hot.

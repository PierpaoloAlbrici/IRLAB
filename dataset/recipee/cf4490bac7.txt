 - 34 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

Instructions: 

Add ingredients in the order given into the bread machine pan. Start dough cycle. (On my machine this takes 2 hours). Once the dough is done remove it from the pan onto a floured work surface. Roll dough to fit the shape of your pan. This recipe makes two 14 inch round pizzas. Brush lightly with olive oil and add toppings. You can hold this dough, with just the olive oil, for a couple of hours in the fridge covered in plastic wrap. Bake in a preheated 450 degree oven for 10-12 minutes. This recipe is the large sized recipe. It also comes in small and medium.

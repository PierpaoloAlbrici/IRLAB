Raspberry Gin


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of raspberries, raw


 - 8 ounce of sugars, granulated


 - 1 pint of alcoholic beverage, distilled, gin, 90 proof


Instructions: 

Put the raspberries and sugar in a pan and heat gently, until the berries are soft and release their juices and the sugar has dissolved. Transfer the mixture to a glass bowl or jar and pour in the gin. Stir, then cover with plastic wrap and seal tightly. Stir daily for 4-5 days, then strain into a clean bottle, seal and store in a dark pantry or the freezer. Taste after about 8 weeks, adding more sugar if necessary. The gin is ready to drink after about 3 months, but is best left for 1 year.

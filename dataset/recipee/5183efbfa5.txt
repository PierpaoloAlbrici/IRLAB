Stiff Porridge (Oshifima)


Ingredients


 - 1 1/4 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow


 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Heat a cup of water to boiling in a medium-sized saucepan. Meanwhile, in a bowl gradually add 3/4 cup of the cornmeal to the milk, stirring briskly to make a smooth paste. Add this mixture to the boiling water, stirring constantly. Cook for 4 or 5 minutes while adding the remaining cornmeal. When mixture begins to pull away from the sides of the pot and stick together, remove from heat. Dump oshifima into a lightly greased bowl. With damp hands, shape it into a smooth ball, turning in the bowl to help smooth it. Serve immediately. To eat in the traditional manner, tear off a piece of oshifima and make an indentation in it with your thumb. Use this hollow to scoop up stew or sauce from a communal bowl.

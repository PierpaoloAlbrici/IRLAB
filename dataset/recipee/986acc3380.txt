Chocolate Truffle Sauce


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 6 ounce of candies, semisweet chocolate


 - 12 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Put the butter and heavy cream in a medium saucepan and heat over medium-low heat until the cream is hot and the butter is melted (the cream will form tiny bubbles). Do not let the mixture boil. Remove pan from heat; add the chocolate and let it soften in the hot cream for about 30 seconds. Add the vanilla and whisk until the sauce is smooth and all the chocolate is melted.

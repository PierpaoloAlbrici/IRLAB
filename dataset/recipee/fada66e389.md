### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of olives, ripe, canned (small-extra large)

 - 12 pound of onions, raw

 - 12 cup of vinegar, red wine

 - 2 tablespoon of orange juice, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 tablespoon of orange juice, raw

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 300. Spread the olives on a large baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes, or until they have shriveled a bit and are slightly crunchy, but not crisped or burned. Let them cool in the pan (they'll dry more and become a bit crunchier). Meanwhile, cut off the root end of each onion, but don't peel them. In a small saucepan, heat 2 cups water and the vinegar to a boil and drop in all the onions, cook for 5 - 10 minutes, depending on their size, until they feel soft all the way through when you squeeze them, but not mushy. Drain and let them cool. Remove the skin (or pop the onion out of the skin by squeezing at the top). If the onions are 3/4" or more, slice them open and flake them apart, separating the layers; tiny onions can be left whole. Toss the olives, onions, and orange zest in a bowl. Dress with the oil and juice to taste. Marinate briefly or overnight, refrigerated, if you want. Serve at room temperature in a shallow bowl with a serving spoon.

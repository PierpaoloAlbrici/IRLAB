Perfect Baked Kale Chips


Ingredients


 - 1/2 pound of kale, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 F. Wash kale and dry in a salad spinner or place in a tea towel, gently roll the towel and swing it over your head (the Julia Child way)! The kale must be dry to bake into chips. Remove the center stem from the kale leaves and rip the leaves into 2 1/2 inch pieces. Follow the natural shape of the leaves to make chip shapes. Place the dried and ripped kale into a large bowl and drizzle extra virgin olive oil along the sides of the bowl. This helps evenly distribute oil onto the leaves. Use your hands and massage the oil into the leaves making sure to have all the leaves covered with oil. Dont worry you cant bruise the kale. On a half sheet pan or rimmed cookie sheet topped with a wire rack, lay the kale leaves in an even layer shiny side down. Bake for 10 minutes or until the chips are crisp to the touch. Remove pan from oven and set it on a rack. Salt the chips as soon as they come out of the oven and carefully move them to a cooling rack. When cool store in airtight zip-top bag or in an airtight container. They will stay crisp for up to two days.

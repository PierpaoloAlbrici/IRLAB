Instructions: 

Put all of the ingredients into the bread pan in the order recommended in the instructions for your bread machine. I usually grind the oats and seeds before adding them, but that isnt necessary. Program the machine for wheat bread with light color setting and press Start. This needs to be made in a large 1 1/2 pound machine.

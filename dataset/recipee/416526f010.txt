Grape and Apricot Liqueur


Ingredients


 - 2 pound of grapes, red or green (european type, such as thompson seedless), raw


 - 1 cup of apricots, dried, sulfured, uncooked


 - 1/8-1/3 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 3-4 cup of alcoholic beverage, distilled, vodka, 80 proof


Instructions: 

Wash and dry the grapes. Discard the stems and place them in a food processor. Process, pulsing the machine, until you get a juicy pulp. Cut the apricots into small pieces with kitchen shears. Place the grape pulp and apricots in a 6-cup jar or bottle; add 2 tblsps to 1/3 cup sugar (depending on how sweet you like your drinks) to the jar and top with vodka. Shake well and leave in a cool, dark place for 3-4 weeks, shaking once a day for the first week so that the sugar dissolves completely. The longer you leave it, the mellower it will become. Strain through a dampened coffee filter. Press down on solids to extract all liquid. Pour into a bottle and seal. Keep in a cool, dark place. Will keep for years.

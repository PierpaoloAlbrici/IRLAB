Healthier Than Bisquick Mix


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 23 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 2 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Thoroughly mix all ingredients in a bowl. Store in a sealed container and use in place of Bisquick. I have substituted this mix in several recipes that call for Bisquick with excellent results. For some recipes you may wish to add a little butter or extra virgin olive oil along with the "Bisquick" mix.

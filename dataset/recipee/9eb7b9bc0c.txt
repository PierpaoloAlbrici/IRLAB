Terrific Whole Wheat in the Breadmaker!


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 34 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 3 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 tablespoon of vital wheat gluten


 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


Instructions: 

NOTE: If you keep your whole wheat flour in the freezer (which is a good idea) be sure to remove it a few hours before-hand so it can warm to room temperature. Measure the ingredients into your machine's loaf pan in the order listed. Be sure NOT to let the yeast touch the water. (By the way, I use bread machine yeast but I'm pretty sure regular yeast works too! ). Set it to "grain" and press start (so it should say 4:10 on the little screen). When finished, remove from the machine, pull out the paddle if it's stuck in, and cover with a tea towel (to keep the crust soft) on a cooling rack. Let the loaf cool at least 20 minutes before slicing. It should stay fresh 4-5 days in normal weather. We usually slice and freeze a portion of the loaf and it defrosts beautifully. Also makes lovely breadcrumbs!

Sandwich Bread


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 3 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Add the ingredients into a large bowl one by one in the order listed before mixing. Mix the flour and salt on top of the yeast and water before mixing all of the ingredients together. Then mix the dough for a few minutes with a rubber spatula to build up the gluten. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise until doubled, about 2 or 3 hours. Cover a baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper. Turn the dough out onto the parchment paper in one dump, so it makes an oval-shaped loaf. Sprinkle the top lightly with flour. Preheat the oven to 525 degrees F (you can bake the bread at a lower temperature if you need to, just adjust the cooking time accordingly) and let the loaf sit uncovered while the oven preheats. Once the oven is preheated, put the bread into the oven and bake the loaf for 20 minutes or until the loaf is brown and slightly charred in places. Remove from the oven and let cool completely before slicing.

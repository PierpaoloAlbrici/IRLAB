 - 16 ounce of cream, sour, cultured

 - 1 cup of lettuce, cos or romaine, raw


 - 1 cup of tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average

Instructions: 

Allow cream cheese to warm and soften. Mix sour cream, cream cheese and taco seasoning in a bowl. Mix until smooth.

Sprinkle the cheddar cheese on top of that. Serve with your favorite taco chips.

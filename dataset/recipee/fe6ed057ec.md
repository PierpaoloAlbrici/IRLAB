### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 225 g of butter, without salt

 - 240 ml of nuts, pecans

 - 120 ml of sugars, powdered

 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 360 ml of sugars, powdered

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 180C (350F). Mix the flour, salt, and the pecans in a bowl with a whisk. In a larger bowl, mix the butter and the powdered sugar until fluffy using a hand mixer. Add the vanilla extract. Add the flour mixture and blend the dough thoroughly. (Avoid mixing too much! It is okay to leave it slightly floury.) Roll the dough into 3-4 cm balls. Place them on the baking sheet that is not oil coated (this is important!) leaving about 3 cm spaces between them. Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes until lightly browned. In a metal tray with 3/4 cup (180 ml) of powdered sugar, put a few of the just baked cookies at a time and coat them with the sugar. Place them on the cooling rack. When all the cookies are coated with powdered sugar and placed on the rack, sprinkle more powdered sugar using a tea strainer. Cool them down completely.

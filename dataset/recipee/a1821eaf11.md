### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of tofu, raw, regular, prepared with calcium sulfate

 - 12 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 13 cup of lemon juice, raw

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cumin seed

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, oregano, dried

 - 1 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Drain and slice the tofu into 1/2 inch slices (slightly thicker slices if you plan to make kebabs) and place between paper towels. Place a weight on top and let drain for about an hour. Pat the slices dry and cut each slich into 3 or 4 triangles. Mix the marinade in a zip-lock bag, add the triangles and refrigerate until needed. Grill the tofu triangles until slightly browned. You could also skewer them with cut up vegetables and baste with the marinade. These are also very good the next day, served chilled with cooked green beans in the leftover marinade/dressing.

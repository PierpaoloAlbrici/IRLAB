Sweet Potato Chips Recipe


Ingredients


 - 4 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 1/2 pound of sweet potato, raw, unprepared


 - 2 teaspoon of vinegar, distilled


 - 1 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Heat the oven to 450 degrees F and arrange the racks in the upper and lower third. Coat 2 baking sheets with 1 teaspoon of the oil each; set aside. Place sweet potatoes in a large bowl, drizzle with vinegar and remaining vegetable oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and toss to coat. Evenly divide potatoes between the prepared baking sheets, spreading in a single layer. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through, until the chips are browned and the edges are crisp, about 25 minutes.

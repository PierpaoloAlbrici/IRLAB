House loaf recipe


Ingredients


 - 560 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 10 g of salt, table


 - 5 g of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 300 ml of water, bottled, generic


 - 20 ml of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

Weigh the flour and salt into a big bowl. Measure the water and oil into a jug. With a fork, stir the yeast into the water. Empty the jug into the bowl and stir all the ingredients together. Then knead the dough for 20 minutes (10 minutes in a mixer). Once you have a smooth and elastic dough nestle it back into the bowl and cover (air tight) and leave it in a warm place to grow to twice its size or for 1 hour (whichever is first). Then by hand, shape your dough so it fits evenly into a well oiled large loaf tin. Dust the top of your loaf with a bit of flour and then cover the tin and leave it in a warm place to double in size or for 1 hour (whichever is first). Meanwhile.. crank up your oven as high as she goes (max 240C). Slash the top of your loaf and offer it into the HOT oven. Check it after 10 minutes and turn the oven down a notch (210C) Take it out when its baked and beautifully golden all over (about 30 minutes) Let the smell of freshly baked bread fill your home and share the joy of a real loaf.

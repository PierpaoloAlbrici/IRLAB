Nutty and Fudgy Almond Butter Granola Bars


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of oats


 - 1 cup of dates, deglet noor


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, pecans


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 13 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 1/4 cup of honey


 - 1/4 cup of nuts, almonds


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 F. Spread rolled oats evenly on a baking sheet and pop them in the oven to toast for about 10-15 minutes, or until the oats become fragrant, shaking the sheet once in the middle of baking. When the oats are done, remove them from the oven, add them into a large mixing bowl and set aside. Line an 8 x 8-inch baking pan with parchment paper. Place dates in a food processor and pulse until a ball is formed. Transfer dates the mixing bowl with the toasted oats, and add the nuts, salt and chocolate chips. Stir with a wooden spoon or your hands, making sure to evenly disperse the dates as much as possible throughout the rest of the ingredients. Bring honey and almond butter to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat then pour it over the dry ingredients. Stir everything together quickly so that your chocolate chips melt. Make sure everything is well mixed. Transfer mixture to your prepared pan and press everything into the pan using a spatula so that you have a smooth and uniformly flat top. Sprinkle some more chocolate chips on top and press them into the bars with the back of a spatula. Top with a piece of plastic wrap, and pop them into the freezer to set for 15 minutes. Remove pan from the freezer, cut into 10 bars and enjoy! Notes: 1. Store in an airtight container or wrapped in plastic wrap in the fridge for up to a week, or in the freezer for longer term storage. 2. For a vegan option, sub maple syrup for the honey and use vegan chocolate chips 3. Recipe adapted from Minimalist Bakers 5 Ingredient Granola Bars.

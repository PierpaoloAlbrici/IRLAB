Chocolate Sauce


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 1/2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1/2 pound of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

In a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan, warm together: 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1/2 cup milk, 1/4 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter. Stir to dissolve the sugar. When the butter is melted, add: 1/2 pound bittersweet chocolate, chopped, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Turn off the heat. Let the mixture stand for a few minutes and then whisk until smooth. Serve warm. This sauce can be covered and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Reheat over simmering water. For a thick chocolate glaze to use as a simple frosting, warm 1/2 cup cream, turn off the heat, add 4 ounces chopped semisweet chocolate, let sit, and whisk together when the chocolate is melted. This will thicken as it cools. While still soft, pour or spread over cakes or cupcakes.

Dairy-Free and Delicious Hot Cocoa


Ingredients


 - 2-3 teaspoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 cup of soymilk, original and vanilla, unfortified


Instructions: 

Pour the soy milk into a microwaveable mug and microwave on high for 1 minute. Add the cocoa powder and sugar and stir well to combine. Note: If using plain soy or rice milk, you can add 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract. I've also added almond extract with wonderful results. The amounts can be tweaked depending on how chocolatey you like your cocoa! Enjoy!

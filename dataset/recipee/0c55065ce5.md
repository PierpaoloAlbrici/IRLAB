### Ingredients

 - 3 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 pound of onions, raw

 - 3 tablespoon of sugars, brown

 - 1 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 2 tablespoon of parsley, fresh

### Instructions

Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions begin to brown on all sides; about 10 - 12 minutes. Add the brown sugar and gently stir in the mustard to make a smooth coating over the onions; add salt, pepper, and 1 tbsp parsley. Cook about 2 minutes longer. Place into a serving bowl and sprinkle with remaining 1 tbsp parsley for garnish.

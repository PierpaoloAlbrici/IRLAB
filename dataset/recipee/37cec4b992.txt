Bread made from Tofu and Brown Rice


Ingredients


 - 200 g of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 50 g of rice flour, white, unenriched


 - 10 g of sugars, granulated


 - 3 g of salt, table


 - 3 g of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 150 g of tofu, raw, regular, prepared with calcium sulfate


 - 40 ml of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

Remove the silken tofu from the package, and place it in a heat-resistant dish together with its liquid, then heat for about 30 seconds in the microwave. Put more than the listed amount of water in a heat-resistant dish, then heat for about 20 seconds in the microwave to heat until lukewarm. Combine the ingredients listed from the bread flour to the dry yeast, and mix with a rubber scraper or similar utensil. Add the tofu and mix well. Add 2 tablespoons lukewarm water and mix well. Gradually add more lukewarm water, a teaspoon at a time, until the dough reaches the right firmness. I use 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons lukewarm water, which is a total of 40 ml. Transfer to a work surface, and knead by repeating a process of pounding and stretching the dough. Once the dough looks like the photo shown, return it to the bowl, and add 1 tablespoon olive oil. Work the olive oil into the dough, then return it to the work surface to knead. It's ready once it is smooth as shown. Return it to the bowl, and let it rise at around 30C until it doubles in size (first proofing). Press your finger into the dough, and if it doesn't return, then remove it from the bowl and lightly press out the air. Divide it in half, form each half into a ball, then let it rest. Here is how it should look after about 15 minutes. Roll each ball of dough into an oval shape with a rolling pin, then fold each end inside. Tightly seal the edge where the two ends meet. Turn over each loaf and evenly shape. Arrange them on a baking tray lined with a sheet of parchment paper, then let them rise at around 35C until they double in size (second proofing). Preheat the oven to 200C. Dampen the tops with a pastry brush dipped in water, sprinkle on sesame seeds, and slash (you may omit these steps). Bake for 10 minutes at 200C, then for 5 minutes at 180C. Adjust the baking time to suit your oven. When there is 3 minutes remaining, I shift their positions to brown evenly. Slice once they cool. Since they have an elastic-like chewy texture, they are easy to cut. This is the brown rice flour I used. I got it at Tomizawa Shoten, a baking supply store.

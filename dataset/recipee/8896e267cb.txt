Buttermilk honey


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Combine the sugar and buttermilk in a non-aluminum saucepan and simmer for about 45 minutes over low heat, stirring frequently so that it does not turn into a transparent cheese. When done, it should sheet from the spoon like jelly and be the color of very light clover honey. It should taste like honey with a slight buttermilk aftertaste. If the buttermilk flavor is too strong, add the baking soda, which sweetens it. However, the baking soda will make it frothy for a few minutes and, if the sugar has impurities, they will come to the surface. You may need to skim it.

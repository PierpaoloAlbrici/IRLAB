Ingredients


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 14 cup of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 12 tablespoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 5 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 1/2 cup of oats


 - 4 teaspoon of butter, without salt

Instructions: 

In a mixing bowl, stir together warm water,Maple syrup& yeast. Set aside for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, make the oatmeal& add butter. Stir to melt butter. When the yeast mixture is bubbly, add 3 cups flour, oatmeal, salt& raisins to the yeast mixture. Mix on low speed until incorporated. Keep adding flour 1/2 cup at a time until the dough comes together& is only slightly tacky to the touch. The dough will be very soft and somewhat sticky. Place dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap& place in a warm place to rise until double in size (about 40 to 60 minutes). Spray a 9"x5" loaf pan with non-stick cooking spray. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface& knead the cinnamon in by sprinkling a little in top, kneading& turning dough& repeating the process until all the cinnamon is used. Place the dough in the prepared loaf pan& place in a warm place to rise. When the dough has risen about 2" above the pan, put into a preheated 350 degrees F oven& bake for about 30 minutes. The crust will be golden brown. Remove from pan& place on a cooling rack. Once the bread has cooled, mix the powdered sugar with 3 T of maple syrup. Add 1 or 2 T of water to thin to a pouring consistency. Pour glaze all over the top of the bread, letting it run down the sides.

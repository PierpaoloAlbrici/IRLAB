Fresh Cranberry Juice


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of cranberries, dried, sweetened


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Wash and pick over the cranberries, discarding any stems or discolored berries. Squeeze the cranberries through an electric juicer. Strain the juice through a very fine sieve to remove the pulp. Combine the sugar and hot water in a pitcher. Stir briskly until the sugar is completely dissolved. Allow to cool. Pour the cranberry juice into the pitcher and mix well. Serve immediately over ice or refrigerate until serving time.

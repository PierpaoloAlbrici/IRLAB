Southern Living Sausage Balls


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 18 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 8 ounce of pork sausage, link/patty, unprepared


 - 4 ounce of cheese, cheddar


 - 3/4 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 400F (200C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with baking paper. In a food processor, pulse together the flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne until combined. Add the butter and pulse about a dozen times until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the sausage and cheddar cheese and pulse until combined, about 1/2 dozen pulses. Transfer mixture to bowl and stir in buttermilk until combined. Working with wet hands, roll 1 tablespoon dough at a time into 1 1/4-inch balls and place, evenly spaced, on baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, 20 to 22 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. Transfer baking sheet to wire rack and let balls cool for 5 minutes. Serve warm.

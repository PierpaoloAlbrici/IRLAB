Heavenly Whole Wheat Buttermilk Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of honey


 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt and honey. Cut in the butter with a pastry blender until coarse, sandlike crumbs form. Pour in the buttermilk and gently stir with a fork. Just add buttermilk until the flour mixture is just barely moist. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead 2-3 times just to bind the dough. Flatten the dough out with your hands or with a rolling pin so its about 1 1/2 inches thick. I usually just use my hands to do this (one less dish to wash) but do whatever you are comfortable with. Using a 2 round cutter, cut out as many rounds as you can get out of the dough. You should get about a dozen. You can re-roll the scraps to make additional biscuits. Place biscuit cutouts on a baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, about 12-15 minutes. Serve warm with butter and honey or your favorite preserves.

### Ingredients

 - 13 cup of syrup, maple, canadian

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 2 cup of nuts, pecans

### Instructions

Preheat a heavy, nonstick or stainless dry skillet over medium heat. In a glass measuring cup, combine the maple syrup, sea salt, vanilla, and cinnamon. Dump nuts into the warmed skillet. Stir them for 30 seconds to lightly toast the nuts. Pour the maple syrup and spices mixture over the nuts. Reduce the heat slightly and stir the nuts with a spatula continuously as the glaze thickens and reduces. This will take several minutes. Continue stirring the nuts while they are cooking to prevent them from burning. Lower the heat if necessary. When the glaze is almost gone, turn off the heat and continue stirring the nuts in the warm skillet until they are no longer sticky but covered with a tan-colored, maple sugar coating. Transfer to a serving plate and enjoy warm! If storing, allow the glazed nuts to cool completely before placing in a sealed container or bag.

Instructions: 

Chopped all veggies and set aside in a bowl. You will slice the peppers and onions into thin strips. You will chopped the broccoli into bite size pieces. You will cook your spaghetti according to the institutions on the box. (Mix this up a little. In this recipe I just use some wheat noodles. However, I have used this with orzo and basmati rice). Take a saute pan (or a good non-stick frying pan) and set the temp to medium heat. Put in 2 tablespoon of oil. Then start sauteing your veggies. Your saute time should be between 4-6 minutes. We want the veggies to be crisp. After you finish this, set the veggies aside in a bowl. You noodles should be al dente (or firmly soft) by this time. Once your noodles are finished cooking,then drain your noodles. Set aside until ready. Bring the saute pan back to the stove. Set temp to medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of olive olive. Put in all the saute veggies, chopped parsley and soy sauce. Cooked just til warm (aproximately 2-3 minutes). Add the noodles and chili garlic sauce. Cook for about another 7-9 minutes all together. VOILA!

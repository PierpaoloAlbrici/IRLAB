### Ingredients

 - 160 g of rice flour, white, unenriched

 - 150 g of cornstarch

 - 100 g of amazonas rainforest product, tapioca starch, upc: 742987126365

 - 150 g of sugars, brown

 - 200 g of butter, without salt

 - 3 tablespoon of nuts, almonds

### Instructions

Pre-heat oven to 350F. In a bowl put the flour, starches and sugar. Mix it well. Add the butter softened and start working to form a dough. When it starts to form crumbs add the almond butter. Knead dough. When you have the dough ready. Put it in the refrigerator wrapped in plastic, for 15 min. I used a cookie press to do the cookies. If you don't have one, you can make little balls and then press them with a fork. Bake them for about 10 min or until you see that they start to light brown the edges. Cool them in a rack... and Enjoy them. P.D. : If you don't have the potatoe starch you can use cornstarch and viceversa. But I recommend you use both.

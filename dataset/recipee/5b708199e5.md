[5b708199e5](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/6493)

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 3 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 3/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

In a large bowl, beat the butter until smooth. Beat in the sugar a little at a time. Beat in the salt. Add the flour in three batches, alternating with additions of 1/4 cup of water, stirring well after each addition. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator and use your hands to roll it into very small balls about 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch in diameter. Transfer the cookies to ungreased cookie sheets. Bake until the bottoms of the cookies just turn golden, about 15 to 20 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.

### Ingredients

 - 1 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/3 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 1/4 cup of cornstarch

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 3/4 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 1/4 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1/2 cup of syrups, corn, light

 - 1/4 cup of butter, without salt

 - 4 cup of nuts, pecans

 - 1/2 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F. Line 13x9x2-inch baking pan with foil, leaving 1-inch overhang on all sides. Butter foil. Blend flour, powdered sugar, cornstarch and salt in processor. Add butter and process until mixture begins to clump together. Press dough evenly onto bottom of foil-lined pan. Bake crust until set and light golden, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven. Let stand while preparing topping. Reduce oven temperature to 325F. Stir brown sugar, corn syrup and butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves and mixture boils; boil 1 minute. Add pecans and cream; boil until mixture thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir in vanilla. Pour hot topping over warm crust. Bake nut-topped crust until caramel is darker and bubbles thickly, about 20 minutes. Transfer pan to rack. Cool completely in pan (topping will harden). Lift foil out of pan onto cutting board. Using heavy sharp knife, cut crust with nut topping into 1 1/2x1-inch diamonds. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Store between sheets of waxed paper in airtight container at room temperature.)

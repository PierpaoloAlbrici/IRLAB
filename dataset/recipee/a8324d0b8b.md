### Ingredients

 - 30 g of sweet potato, raw, unprepared

 - 1/3 teaspoon of miso

 - 15 g of sugars, granulated

 - 30 g of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

### Instructions

Boil or microwave the sweet potato until tender, then mash. Since this recipe uses only a small amount, you can even use leftovers. Combine all of the ingredients in a bowl, and mix until evenly incorporated. Scoop out a spoonful of dough, then drop in rows on parchment paper. This recipe yields about 16 crackers. Place a sheet of parchment paper cut into 7 cm squares over the dough, then press down with your fingers to flatten them evenly. Bake in oven preheated to 355F/180C for 8-10 minutes, and watch closely to make sure that they cook evenly. They're ready when they are lightly browned. After cooling, if they snap when broken, they're done. If they don't snap after cooling down, pop them back into the oven set at 320F/160C, then stand by to make sure they don't burn. Chewing them well releases the enjoyable aroma of the sesame seeds. This also is a great way to absorb the nutrients.

Rosemary Roasted Pecans


Ingredients


 - 3 pound of nuts, pecans


 - 13 cup of butter, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 14 cup of spices, rosemary, dried


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a single layer, place the pecans on a cookie sheet and bake for 30 minutes (I use 2 baking sheets to keep the pecans in single layer). Once they have baked for 30 minutes, remove the pecans from the oven and add the 1/3 cup melted butter to the pecans, mixing well. Return the pecans to the oven for another 10 minutes. Remove from oven again and add the salt and the other 2 tablespoons of butter. Stir the pecans well and return to the oven for another 10 minutes. In a small bowl, mix the rosemary, cayenne and brown sugar. Remove the pecans from the oven and toss the pecans lightly with the rosemary and sugar mixture, while they are still warm. (I used a large Ziploc bag and shake the mixtures together). Serve warm.

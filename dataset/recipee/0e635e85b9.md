### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

 - 3 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Combine rice and water in a medium to large saucepan with a secure fitting lid (vents closed). Bring to the boil (you will see bubbles forming around the lid - do NOT open the lid) and turn off the heat. Leave to stand for about 20-25 minutes. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT open the lid at any time until after the 25 minutes is up. Fluff the rice with a fork and serve immediately.

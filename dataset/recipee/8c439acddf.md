### Ingredients

 - 15 cup of apples, raw, with skin

 - 12 cup of lemon juice, raw

 - 1 1/2 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 3 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, cloves, ground

### Instructions

In the evening, peel, core and slice enough apples so that your crockpot's lid is resting on top of the apples (they will cook down). Remove and toss with lemon juice. Poor apples and lemon juice back into crockpot and cover. Cook for about 18 hours on low (7 to 10 hours on high), stirring a couple of times as the apples soften. Mix in the sugar, ground cinnamon and cloves. Cook for 4 more hours. Pour into sterilize jars.

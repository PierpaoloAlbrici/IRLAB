### Ingredients

 - 1 1/4 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw

 - 8 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 8 teaspoon of honey

 - 2 tablespoon of dill weed, fresh

 - 1 tablespoon of orange juice, raw

### Instructions

Pre-heat oven to 375F Wash the chicken breast fillets and pat dry. If one side is much thicker than the other you may want to give it a quick pound with a meat mallet (skin-side down) to even it out. For the sauce, mix the Dijon mustard, honey, dill and orange zest in a small bowl, stir well. Brush both sides of the fillets with the marinade and bake the chicken for 30 minutes. Cut the fillets with a sharp knife on the thickest part, if the juices run clear they are done.

Butter a 10 x 15 inch jelly roll pan. Melt 1 cup butter in deep, heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar, water and salt and cook, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Bring to boil, simmer, stirring frequently, until mixture is color of a brown paper bag and temperature registers 300 F on a candy thermometer (about 5- 6 minutes). Remove from heat, stir in almonds and pour mixture into prepared pan. Smooth the top with a buttered heat proof spatula. With a paper towel, carefull blot the top (mixture is hot) to remove any excess butter. Immediately scatter chocolate chips on top. Let stand until melted, about 1 minute, then spread evenly over top. This is when I pressed the ground almonds into the chocolate. Cool to room termperature, then chill 20 minutes before breaking into pieces. Layer between wax paper in airtight container and store in refrigerator up to 2 wekks.

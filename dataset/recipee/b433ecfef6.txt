Baby Hasselback Potatoes


Ingredients


 - 3/4 pound of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 pinch of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 425 F. Place a potato on a wooden spoon. Start at one end of the potato and use a large knife to cut until the knife touches the top of the spoon (using the spoon will make sure you dont cut through the bottom of the potato). Continue cutting at about 3 to 4 mm intervals across the whole potato. Set the cut potatoes aside and continue until all the potatoes are cut this way. Gently use your fingers to slightly open the potatoes, then toss them together with the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Let them marinate for 5 to 10 minutes. Arrange the potatoes on a baking sheet and bake until crispy on the outside and tender inside, about 30 minutes. (Adapted from Sea Salt with Foods recipe for Spiced Mini Hasselback Potatoes).

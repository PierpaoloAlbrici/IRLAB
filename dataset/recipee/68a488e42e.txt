Butter-and-Shortening Pastry Dough


Ingredients


 - 2 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 6 tablespoon of shortening, vegetable, household, composite


 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 6 to 7 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

In a food processor, pulse the flour and salt. Add the shortening and butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal. With the motor running, pour water through the feed tube and process until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl, adding no more water than necessary. Divide dough into 2 balls, flatten them into thick disks and place them between sheets of waxed paper. Refrigerate for at least one hour before rolling out.

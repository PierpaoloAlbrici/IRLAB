Blueberry Cobbler


Ingredients


 - 3 pint of blueberries, raw


 - 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 4 teaspoon of cornstarch


 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 1 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


Instructions: 

STEP 1: Preheat the oven to 450F. Have ready a 1 1/2 quart shallow baking dish. STEP 2: To make the filling: Combine the blueberries, water, sugar, cornstarch, and lemon juice in a large saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring constantly, over medium high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the berries are softened. Transfer the mixture to the baking dish. STEP 3: To make the biscuits: Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Beat the cream with an electric mixer on medium-high speed in a large deep bowl just until it holds soft peaks when the beaters are lifted. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, spoon in the cream, and stir with a fork just until a dough begins to form. STEP 4: On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough several times. Pat the dough out to 3/4 inch thick and, with a 2 1/2-inch cutter cut out 6 rounds. Gather the scraps together and pat out again if necessary. Arrange on top of the berries, brush with cream, and sprinkle with sugar. STEP 5: Bake for 15 to 17 mintues, until the berries are bubbling and the biscuits are browned. Let the cobbler cool slightly, and serve warm.

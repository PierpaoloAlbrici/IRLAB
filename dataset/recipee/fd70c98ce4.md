### Ingredients

 - 6 1/2 pound of peaches, yellow, raw

 - 1 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 13 cup of lemon juice, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, ginger, ground

### Instructions

In a food processor, chop peaches in batches to a chunky puree (about 4 1-second pulses), transfer to a 6-quart pot or dutch oven. Add sugar, lemon juice and ginger. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Turn heat to low, and simmer 1 1/2 hours, stirring every 5 minutes. With a spoon, transfer the preserves to 3 pint jars. Fill jars to 1/2-inch from the rim, close the jars and let them cool. Store in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

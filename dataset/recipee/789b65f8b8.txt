Basic White Bread for Bread Machine Abm


Ingredients


 - 34 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 1/4 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


Instructions: 

If you have to proof the yeast first, proof it in the sugar and water in the bread machine's basin for 10-15 minutes or until foamy; then mix the other ingredients together and pop it in for the Basic Medium or Basic White cycle. If not, just throw everything in, hit the Basic Medium or Basic White cycle for a 1-lb capacity, and kick back and let the machine do its work! The 1-lb loaf yields about 10 large slices. For 1.5-lb loaf, use 1 cup water, 3 tablespoons oil, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 3 cups bread flour (3 TB vital wheat gluten + 3 cups AP flour) and 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast. For 2-lb loaf, use 1 1/3 cups water, 1/4 cup oil, 1/4 cup sugar, 2 teaspoons salt, 4 cups bread flour (4 TB vital wheat gluten + 4 cups AP flour), and 1 tablespoon active dry yeast.

### Ingredients

 - 7-8 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 4 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt

 - 2 cup of pretzels, soft, unsalted

 - 1 cup of corn, sweet, white, raw

### Instructions

Mix all dry ingredients together. Melt white chocolate over stove or in microwave (stove might burn it, I recommend using microwave). Pour chocolate over dry mixture and mix well. Section off mixture into smaller pieces (doesn't have to be neat or a certain size) and place in fridge for about 10 minutes, or until hard.

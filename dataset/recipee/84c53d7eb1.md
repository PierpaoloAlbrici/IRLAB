### Ingredients

 - 14 ounce of salad dressing, ranch dressing, regular

 - 1/2 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular

 - 1/2 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

 - 16 ounce of cheese, cheddar

 - 12 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 1 cup of nuts, pecans

### Instructions

In a medium bowl, combine the dressing mix, mayonnaise, buttermilk, Cheddar, and cream cheese until thoroughly blended. Divide the mixture into two equal portions in two separate bowls. Cover the bowls and place them in the freezer for 30 minutes. When each portion is firm, use your hands to shape it into a ball. Place the nuts in a shallow bowl or on a piece of waxed paper. Roll each ball in the nuts to coat it on all sides. Serve with crackers or bagel chips. Let this sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before serving for easier spreading.

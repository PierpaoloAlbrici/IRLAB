### Ingredients

 - 4 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

 - 4 tablespoon of sauce, worcestershire

 - 1 tablespoon of catsup

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

may need to double the sauce if using more than one pound meat. I sometimes even need to triple the sauce if I am making a big batch. You want the meat to be covered in the sauce. Cut your meat into thin strips. (You can use venison or beef, and I usually use an inexpensive cut of meat). I usually use a couple pounds of the meat and then double the sauce. Mix all of the sauce ingredients. Marinade with the meat overnight. Use with your food dehydrator according to directions.

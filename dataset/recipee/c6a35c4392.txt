Fastest French Bread


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Combine the flour, yeast, and salt in a bowl or food processor. Add 1 1/4 cups of warm water all at once, stirring with a wooden spoon or with the machine on. Continue to mix, for a minute or two longer by hand, for about 30 seconds total with the food processor. Add water by the tablespoon if necessary, until a ball forms. Shape the dough into a flat round or long loaf, adding only enough flour to allow you to handle the dough. Put the dough on a baking sheet or a well-floured pizza peel. Let it rise in the warmest place in your kitchen, covered, while you preheat the oven to 425F. (If you have time, let the dough rise for an hour or so.) Bake the bread on the sheet, or slide it onto a baking stone. Bake until done, 30 to 45 minutes; the crust will be golden brown, crisp, and firm.

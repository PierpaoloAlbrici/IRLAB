Heat oven to 400F. Mix flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda and salt in medium bowl. Cut in butter using pastry blender or 2 knives, until mixture looks like fine crumbs. Stir in buttermilk so dough leaves sides of bowl and forms a ball. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface. Knead lightly 10 times. Pat or roll into 7 inch circle on ungreased cookie sheet that has been sprinkled with cornmeal. Score top into 8 wedges, cutting down halfway to the bottom.

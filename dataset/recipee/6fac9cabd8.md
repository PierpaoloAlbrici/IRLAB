### Ingredients

 - 10 ounce of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. In a food processor, pulse to combine flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Once those ingredients are combined, add cold butter cubes and pulse mixture about 10 times to break down butter into small pea-sized pieces. Add buttermilk, then pulse about 10 times until dough clumps together in one side of the food processor. Use a large 3-tablespoon cookie scoop to drop scoops of the biscuit mixture onto a baking sheet. You should have 12 scoops. Bake for 15 minutes in the lower third of the oven until golden brown. Enjoy!

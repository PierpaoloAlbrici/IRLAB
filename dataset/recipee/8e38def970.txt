 - 1/4 cup of nuts, cashew nuts, raw


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 1/4 cup of dates, deglet noor


Instructions: 

1. In a food processor, chop cashews. Leave cashew pieces in the food processor. 2. Add cinnamon to the cashews and continue chopping cashews and cinnamon until cashews are finely chopped. Pour cashews into a separate large bowl. You do not need to rinse the food processor. 3. In the food processor, chop cranberries to small pieces (maybe a little smaller than a quarter of the original sizeit does not have to be precise). Dump cranberries in the large bowl with the cashews. You do not need to rinse the food processor. 4. In the food processor, chop pitted dates to about the same size as you did the cranberries. Dump dates into the large bowl with the cashews and cranberries. 5. Using your hands (you can wear food-grade gloves), combine the mixture until well mixed. 6. Divide mixture into fourths and roll each into a ball and work into a log. 7. Place a log on waxed paper and fold the waxed paper over the log. Then work the log into a bar or rectangle. 8. Wrap each bar in plastic wrap. 9. Store in an airtight container. You can place it in the refrigerator to keep longer, but it is not required.

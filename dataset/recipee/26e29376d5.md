### Ingredients

 - 1/4 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 4 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 3 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Grease a cookie sheet with the almond oil. Place the almonds on a separate baking sheet and toast them until light golden grown, about 5 minutes. Set aside. In a medium, very heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the sugar and water and cook over medium-high heat until the sugar liquefies, then turns light golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes. Do not stir, but brush the sugar crystals off the sides of the pot with a wet pastry brush as necessary. Once the sugar begins to brown, watch carefully and remove from heat as soon as it is the desired color, as the sugar can burn quickly. Once the caramel is off the heat, immediately add the almonds to the pot and stir quickly to incorporate. Turn out onto the prepared cookie sheet, spreading quickly to an even thickness. Allow the brittle to cool completely, then break into festive shapes.

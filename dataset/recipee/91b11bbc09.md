[91b11bbc09](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/desserts/chocolate-covered-cherries-2/)

### Ingredients

 - 10 ounce of cherries, sweet, raw

 - 1 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 1 teaspoon of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

### Instructions

Drain cherries from jar (reserve juice for another use) and with a paper towel, light dab so they are dried. Line baking sheet or counter with parchment paper. In a microwave safe cup (I used a Pyrex measuring cup), add chocolate and coconut oil. Place in microwave and cook for 30 seconds. Stir and cook for another 20 seconds or until chocolate is melted. Take cherries by the stem and simply dip in melted chocolate. Place on parchment paper. Do this until all cherries are covered in chocolate. Let chocolate-covered cherries rest for 30 minutes or until hardened. I recommend refrigerating the cherries until ready to eat.

Grilled Chicken Breast with Pineapple Rum Glaze


Ingredients


 - 1/4 cup of butter, salted


 - 1/4 cup of alcoholic beverage, distilled, rum, 80 proof


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1/4 cup of pineapple juice, canned or bottled, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid


Instructions: 

Mix all 4 ingredients and place in heavy saucepan. Over medium heat, cook until syrupy and reduced. It should be thick enough to brush on chicken, but not runny. Stir briskly. It may separate at first, but keep whisking and it will combine as thickening. Once thickened, brush over chicken, pork, ribs, ham etc.. This is a versatile sauce and I like coating my meat while grilling a few times while flipping so it gets a sticky consistency. Serve as sandwich, plain with sides and I love it over a bed of wild rice. I use pineapple juice also when cooking my rice. Whatever the amount of water it calls for, use half juice half water if you like. I sometimes use a small amount of crushed pineapple to give it some texture and it is great! Makes 1 cup of glaze. You can double if you need more.

Preheat oven to 350 degees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8 inch square baking dish. In a large bowl, mix together the semolina flour (Cream of Wheat), baking powder, 1 cup sugar, coconut and butter. Add the yogurt and milk; mix until all is well moistened, but not runny. It should be the consistency of brownie batter. If it's too dry, add a little more milk. Spread into prepared baking dish, smooth the top. Bake 45 minutes until golden brown. While it is baking, make the syrup: Combine the water and sugar, bring to a boil and boil for at least 5 minutes. You can do this on top of the stove or in the microwave. When it is finished baking, pour the syrup over the hot cake and place back into the oven for 5 minutes or until the syrup has been fully absorbed. Allow to cool to room temperature before serving.

### Ingredients

 - 3 pound of asparagus, raw

 - 1/2 cup of vinegar, red wine

 - 1 tablespoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 1 tablespoon of chives, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of parsley, fresh

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, tarragon, dried

 - 2 teaspoon of shallots, raw

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1 1/2 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Tie the asparagus together loosely in bundles of 4 or 5. Place the bundles in salted boiling water and blanch until the asparagus are bright green and tender-crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove, drain, and place into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Remove the asparagus from the ice bath and refrigerate until ready for use. To prepare the Mustard-Herb Vinaigrette, combine the vinegar, mustard, herbs, shallots, and garlic in a large mixing bowl. Gradually, whisk in the oil until well blended. Adjust seasonings with salt, sugar, and pepper to taste. Place the chilled asparagus in the vinaigrette and toss until well coated. Keep chilled until ready for service.

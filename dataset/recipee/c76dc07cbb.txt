Ingredients


 - 70 g of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022


 - 70 g of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 25 g of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Measure and prepare the ingredients. Bring the butter to room temperature. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler. Remove it from the heat once the temperature reaches 50C (122F). Meanwhile, heat the heavy cream until just before boiling. Add the 1/3 of the heavy cream from Step 3 into the chocolate from Step 2 and mix well. Once it is evenly mixed, add the remaining heavy cream in 2 batches. Once it has cooled, mix in the butter 1 tablespoon at a time with a hand mixer. When all of the butter is mixed in, beat at low speed for about a minute. Immediately move it into an airtight container, cover with a plastic wrap so that it sticks firmly to the surface of the chocolate cream, and let it cool. If you are using it as macaron filling, chill it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes before adding it into the pastry bag. It gets a little harder and will be easier to pipe out.

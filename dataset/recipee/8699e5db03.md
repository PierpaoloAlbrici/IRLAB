### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 2/3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 13 cup of rice flour, white, unenriched

 - 12 cup of sugars, brown

### Instructions

Cream butter and sugar until smooth. Mix in sifted all purpose flour and rice flour. Mix with finger tips (don't use food processor) until dough is crumbly but will stick together if pressed. Spread and press evenly in a 8" spring form pan or two ceramic shortbread pans. I like mine about 3/4" thick. If making individual cookies, roll dough into 2" balls and press with decorative cookie mold or bottom of a glass - at least 1/4" thick. Bake in a preheated 325 degree oven for *45 minutes. Remove from oven and with a sharp knife score into eight wedges cutting about 3/4" way through dough. Return to oven, bake another *6 or 7 minutes. *these times work well in my oven - cookie is lightly browned and can be handled without crumbling or breaking apart. Remove pan(s) from oven and let cool on a cake rack. When cool, loosen sides carefully with a knife and carefully separate wedges. Lasts several days in a well sealed cookie tin. Freezes well. If carefully packed, ships well. Can also be made in 9" x 13" pan and cut into "fingers". This recipe makes enough dough for two eight-wedge shortbread pans or 1 8" spring form pan but they are a little thicker in the spring form pan.

Onion Party Dip


Ingredients


 - 1 teaspoon of chives, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of onions, raw


 - 18 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, parsley, dried


 - 1 tablespoon of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, onion powder


 - 1 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular


 - 1 cup of cream, sour, cultured


Instructions: 

Stir the seasonings together in a small bowl. Put the mayonnaise and sour cream into a larger bowl. Stir in the seasonings and mix until completely combined. Refrigerate at least 2 hours. Serve with chips, veggies, or pretzels. This recipe makes two cups of dip. I usually make the spice mix and use only 1/2 cup mayonnaise and 1/2 cup sour cream with half of the spice mix and save the other half for another time. Enjoy!

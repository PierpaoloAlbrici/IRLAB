Rice Flour Bread in a Pound Cake Mold


Ingredients


 - 200 g of rice flour, white, unenriched


 - 4 g of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 10 g of sugars, granulated


 - 15 g of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 3 g of salt, table


 - 175 g of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Combine 2 g of the sugar with the dry yeast, then add 1 tablespoon of the lukewarm water and dissolve. Pour the rice flour into a separate bowl, making a small mound. Make a well in the center and add the remaining sugar (5 g). In the same bowl, add the salt and oil to the side. Add the dry yeast to the sugar, then add the remaining lukewarm water. Mix with a rubber spatula or whisk until smooth. Pour the batter into a cake pan greased with oil. In winter, let rise for 30 minutes; in the summer, 20 minutes. The times are guidelines. The picture shows it after it has risen. (see Step 15 and 16) Once the rising has finished, cover the pound cake pan with kitchen parchment paper, then top that with aluminum foil. Preheat the oven to 200C and bake for 30 minutes. To prevent the cake from drying out, bake it along with a heatproof dish filled with hot water. For the bread pictured in the top photo, I removed the paper and foil in the last 5 minutes of baking to brown on top. After baking, immediately remove from the pan. Let cool on a rack. Once cooled, wrap with plastic wrap. Let it cool completely before slicing or it will not slice cleanly. Wrap individual slices in plastic wrap and store in the freezer. If you toast it, the outside will be crunchy and the inside will be soft. I tried making it into a sandwich. Don't use fillings with a lot of moisture. This recipe is steamed in the microwave rather than the oven.. For the rising, you can use the rising setting on your oven. To prevent it from drying out, bake with 2 trays of hot water. After pouring the batter into the pan, be sure to tap it against a counter or work surface to release the air bubbles. If there are air bubbles, the cake will end up with big wholes and lack smoothness.

Pistachio Chocolate Bark


Ingredients


 - 8 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 4 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 1 ounce of nuts, pistachio nuts, raw


Instructions: 

Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or waxed paper. Melt the dark chocolate according to packaging directions. Evenly spread on the lined baking sheet in an area approximately 8 x 8. Melt white chocolate according to package directions. Drizzle white chocolate over dark chocolate. Gently spread white chocolate over dark chocolate, or (this is much more fun) using a toothpick, swirl white chocolate around in swirly-swirl patterns. Have fun with it! Sprinkle top with chopped pistachios. Chill in refrigerator about 10-15 minutes, or until chocolate hardens. Break into pieces. Serve or store in an airtight container at room temperature until ready to serve.

Flaky Cream Cheese Pie Crust


Ingredients


 - 12 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 14 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 4 1/2 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 tablespoon of vinegar, cider


Instructions: 

FOOD PROCESSOR METHOD. Cut the butter into small (about 3/4-inch) cubes. Wrap it in plastic wrap and freeze it until frozen solid, at least 30 minutes. Place the flour, salt and baking powder in resealable gallon-size freezer bag and freeze for at least 30 minutes. Place the flour mixture in food processor with the metal blade and process for a few seconds to combine. Set the bag aside for later use here. Cut the cream cheese into 3 or 4 pieces and add it to the flour. Process for about 20 seconds or until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the frozen butter cubes and pulse until none of the butter is larger than the size of a pea. (Toss with a fork to see it better.) Remove the processor cover and sprinkle in the water and vinegar. Pulse until most of the butter is reduced to size of small peas. The mixture will be in particles and will not hold together. Spoon half the dough into the plastic bag. (For a double-crust pie, it is easiest to divide the mixture in half at this point) Holding both ends of the bag opening with your fingers, knead the mixture by alternately pressing it, from the outside of the bag, with the knuckles and heels of your hands until the mixture holds together in one piece and feels slightly stretchy when pulled. Remove the dough from the bag and wrap it with plastic wrap, and flatten it into a disc. Repeat with remaining pie dough. Refrigerate the discs for at least 45 minutes, preferably overnight. Store refrigerated, up to 2 days; frozen, up to 3 months.

Tortas De Aceite Y Anis


Ingredients


 - 2 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 3 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 4 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 1/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, anise seed


 - 2 teaspoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried


 - 34 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 1/2 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 6 drop of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Measure the flour and put in a bowl. Add the liquid ingredients and mix well. Mix in the other dry ingredients, except for the 1/4 cup sugar to be used for dredging, and knead for just a couple of minutes. Cover the dough and let rise until doubled in size. The amount of time required will depend on the yeast and the dough temperature, but probably about 1.5 hours. Preheat a convection oven to 375. A standard oven to about 400 degrees. Place parchment paper on your baking sheet. When dough has doubled, punch it down to deflate it. Pinch off plum sized balls of dough, and roll into circles about 8 inches across and 1/8 inch thick. Note: Don't worry about using flour on the countertop, the oil will be oozing from every pore of the dough and it won't stick to anything. Put the sugar for dredging on a plate. Dredge one side of the torta by laying it on the plate of sugar. Place torta sugar side up, onto the parchment covered baking sheet. Bake tortas about 10 minutes. You will want to watch as they get close to the end to make sure they don't get too dark. Remove tortas from the baking sheet and cool them on a rack. Eat and enjoy!

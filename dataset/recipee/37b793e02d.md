### Ingredients

 - 8 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 1/2 cup of cream, sour, cultured

 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of dill weed, fresh

 - 1 teaspoon of horseradish, prepared

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1/4 pound of fish, salmon, atlantic, wild, raw

### Instructions

Cream the cheese in an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment until just smooth. Add the sour cream, lemon juice, dill, horseradish, salt, and pepper, and mix. Add the smoked salmon and mix well. Chill and serve with crudites or crackers. If you can find it, I prefer Norwegian salmon; it's drier and less salty than other smoked salmon.

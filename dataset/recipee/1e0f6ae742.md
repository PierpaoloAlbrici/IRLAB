### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 tablespoon of shortening, vegetable, household, composite

 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 6 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Put the flour, shortening, baking powder, and salt in food processor. With the machine running, add the water through the feed tube; process just until a soft dough forms. Divide the dough into 6 pieces and shape each into a ball. Roll each ball out between sheets of plastic wrap into a 6-inch round. Set a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat and heat until a drop of water sizzles in it. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add a dough round and cook until speckled and slightly puffed, about 1 1/2 minute on each side. Transfer the tortilla to a plate lined with a clean kitchen towel; fold the towel over to keep the tortilla warm. Cook the remaining dough rounds to make a total of 6 tortillas, stacking them in the towel as they are cooked. To reheat the tortillas, wrap each one in a separate paper towel or napkin and microwave on High until heated, about 5 seconds for each tortilla.

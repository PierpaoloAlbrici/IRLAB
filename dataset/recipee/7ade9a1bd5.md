### Ingredients

 - 500 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 300 ml of water, bottled, generic

 - 12 teaspoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, fennel seed

### Instructions

In a big bowl combine flour and salt. Mix in olive oil and water. Knead into a soft and sturdy dough. It should be smooth. Cover the bowl and allow to rest for 40 minutes at room temperature. Form dough into about 7 equally sized balls. Roll out the balls to 1/2 inch thickness (note: these wont rise much, so make them as thick as youd like them to be in the end. ). Place on a paper-lined baking sheet, brush with water and sprinkle with the sesame and nigella seeds. Bake in the preheated oven at 200C/400F for 15 minutes or until tester comes out clean.

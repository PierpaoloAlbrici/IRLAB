### Ingredients

 - 5 cup of apples, raw, with skin

 - 5 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 tablespoon of vinegar, distilled

### Instructions

Boil applesauce on high heat, then add in sugar and vinegar. I hold the cinnamon till last 1/2 hour because I think it evaporates some. Cook on high heat (about 4 hrs) till the apple butter is as thick as you want it when you cold and serve.

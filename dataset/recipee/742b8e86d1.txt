Chocolate-Coated Almonds


Ingredients


 - 1/3 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 3 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 1/4 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 5 ounce of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022

In a saucepan, combine the sugar and water and boil over moderate heat without stirring until the syrup reaches 248 on a candy thermometer, 10 minutes. Add the almonds and stir to coat. Spread the nuts in a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet; let cool. Drizzle the melted chocolate over the candied almonds and refrigerate until the chocolate is set, about 15 minutes.

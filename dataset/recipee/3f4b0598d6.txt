Hot Chile Cashew Brittle


Ingredients


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 12 teaspoon of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, chili powder


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, chili powder


 - 2 cup of nuts, cashew nuts, raw


Instructions: 

Using a cookie sheet with sides, grease with oil and set aside. Combine the sugar, water, cream of tartar and chile powders in a saucepan. Cook the mixture over high heat, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon, until it turns a light golden colour ( approximately 10-12 minutes). Be very careful working with this caramel as it is extremely HOT! Brush down the sides of the pan twice with a pastry brush dipped in water to prevent the mixture from crystallizing. While stirring, add the cashews. When nuts are completely coated, remove the caramel from the heat and pour onto the cookie sheet, spreading it out with the spoon. Do this step as quickly as possible because the candy sets up fast! Allow brittle to cool 30 minutes. Break into pieces with your hands. Store in an airtight containers. An important note: Red chile powder is made from hot red chiles that have been dried and ground. Do not confuse chile powder with chili powder, the common spice used to make chili.

### Ingredients

 - 8 ounce of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022

 - 1/2 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 1/4 cup of blackberries, raw

 - 23 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 13 cup of sugars, powdered

### Instructions

Place the chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan, bring the heavy cream to a simmer. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let sit 12 minutes. Whisk the mixture together until a thick, smooth ganache forms. Whisk in the blackberry preserves. Cover and refrigerate until the mixture is firm and scoopable, about 2 hours. Combine the cocoa powder and confectioners sugar in a shallow dish and whisk to blend. Using a small scoop or measuring spoon, scoop a small amount of the filling mixture and roll into a smooth ball, about 1 inch in diameter. Roll each finished truffle in the cocoa powder mixture so that it is very lightly coated. Chill truffles until ready to serve.

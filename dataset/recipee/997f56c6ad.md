### Instructions

Combine the flour, powdered sugar, and cocoa powder; set aside. Cream the butter and vanilla with an electric mixer on medium-low speed until fluffy. Gradually stir in the flour mixture until well blended. Cover and chill dough for at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350F. Shape dough into 1" balls; shape balls into 2" logs about 1/2" thick. Space 2" apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 12 minutes, or until set. Cool on cookie sheets for 2 minutes; transfer cookies to wire racks and cool completely. Melt the white chocolate chips in a saucepan over very low heat, stirring, until smooth. Place the sprinkles in a small bowl. Dip each end of the cooled cookies into the white chocolate, then the sprinkles. Return to the wire racks and let stand until the chocolate has set, about 25 minutes.

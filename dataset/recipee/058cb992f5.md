### Ingredients

 - 300 g of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 3 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 3 tablespoon of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 15 g of butter, without salt

 - 120 ml of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Combine bread flour, sugar and salt in a bowl. Whisk well. Pour lukewarm water (I warm it to 60C), yeast and yogurt into a measuring cup. Stir well. Now pour this yogurt mixture into the flour bowl and knead until dough forms. Then add butter and knead some more. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Allow the dough to double in size at room temperature. If you are in a hurry, you could speed it by placing over a double broiler or in your oven. Divide the dough into 6 portions and let rest for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile preheat the oven to 200C. Roll the dough to 2 mm thin and bake in the oven for 7 minutes. Alternatively, you could cook both sides of the naan using a frying pan. Even better!

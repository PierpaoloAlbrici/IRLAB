### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of goji berries, dried

 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 8 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 14 cup of sugars, powdered

### Instructions

Put berries in a bowl & cover with the reg sugar, to bring out the juices. Do this the night before or the morning of. blend cream cheese & powdered sugar together, then fold in the berries. Once you have your crepes made you put the filling in and fold up the crepes. Filling is better in my eyes if you warm the crepes up a little in the microwave after filling them. (Warming the filling before you stuff the crepes could make it pretty runny. ).

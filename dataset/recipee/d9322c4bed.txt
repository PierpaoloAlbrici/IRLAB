Pan Fried Bread


Ingredients


 - 1 ounce of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

In a medium bowl, stir together yeast, lukewarm water, half the flour, sugar, and salt; let stand 10 minutes so that the yeast can start to ferment. Stir in the buttermilk and the remainder of the flour. Place a moist cloth over the dough and let rise for 20 minutes; the dough will still be a bit sticky. Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat. Drop a spoonful of dough in the pan, that has been lightly greased; spread the dough out and fry for 3 minutes on each side. Repeat with remaining dough.

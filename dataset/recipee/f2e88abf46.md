### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of jams and preserves, apricot

 - 12 cup of sugars, brown

 - 12 cup of alcoholic beverage, distilled, whiskey, 86 proof

 - 1 tablespoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

### Instructions

Put all the ingredients into a small saucepan and heat over a medium heat until the jam is liquified and the mixture begins to become like syrup. You might want to stir this mixture to make sure it doesn't stick or burn because of the high sugar content. Baste ham during the baking process and pour some of the glaze up into a bowl to use as a sauce on the side.

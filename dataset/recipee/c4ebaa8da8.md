### Ingredients

 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1/2 cup of pancakes, plain, dry mix, complete (includes buttermilk)

 - 2 pound of mollusks, scallop, (bay and sea), cooked, steamed

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Heat a non-stick frying pan on the stove, on Medium-High heat. Place a dollop of butter into the frying pan, and a touch of olive oil. Allow it to heat up until bubbly. Place 1/2 cup of instant pancake mix (dry) onto a plate. Toss the scallops in the pancake mix, then straight into the frying pan. Fry the scallops in the butter. Allow to fry for approximately 2 minutes, then toss them around the pan, adding a dash of pepper and salt. Cook for another 2 minutes. Then serve! Scallops should be cooked enough so that they split, and they should bounce a bit when you touch them with a fork. They shouldnt be cooked so much that they are as hard as a hockey puck. Enjoy with your favourite side dish!

Sesame-Anise Bread


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of house of pasta, pizza dough, upc: 074708983316


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, anise seed


 - 1 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Combine the pizza dough, olive oil, melted butter, sugar, sesame seeds, anise seeds and orange-flower water in a food processor; pulse until the ingredients are incorporated and the dough gathers around the blade. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly oil the parchment. Form the dough into a ball and pat into a 6-inch disk on the parchment. Cover with a large bowl; let rise in a warm place until airy and spread into a flat round, 1 hour, 30 minutes to 2 hours. Put an upside-down baking sheet in the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Remove the bowl from the dough; put the baking sheet with the dough on the hot baking sheet in the oven and bake until golden, about 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F and continue baking until the bread sounds hollow when tapped, 15 to 20 more minutes. Let cool slightly before slicing. Photograph by Christina Holmes

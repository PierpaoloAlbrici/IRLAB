Easy Peach Cobbler Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of cornstarch


 - 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1/8 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 pound of peaches, yellow, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 4 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1/4 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


Instructions: 

Heat the oven to 425 degrees F and arrange a rack in the middle. Place the brown sugar, lemon juice, cornstarch, vanilla, and salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Add the peaches and stir until evenly coated. Transfer the mixture to an 8-by-8-inch glass or ceramic baking dish, arrange in an even layer, and scatter the butter pieces over the top. Bake until the peaches are starting to soften and release their juices, about 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the topping. Whisk together the flour, 3 tablespoons of the sugar, the baking powder, and baking soda in a large bowl to combine. Add the butter and toss with your fingers until well coated in the flour mixture. Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until reduced to pea-size pieces, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the buttermilk or yogurt and stir until a soft, crumbly dough forms. Divide the dough into 9 equal portions. Form each portion into a 2-inch-wide patty and place on a large plate. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside. When the peaches are ready, remove the baking dish from the oven, stir to coat the peaches in the juices, and arrange in an even layer again. Place the dough patties in a single layer on top. Sprinkle the remaining tablespoon of sugar evenly over the top of the cobbler. Bake until the biscuits are golden brown and the filling is bubbling around the edges, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool for at least 20 minutes before serving.

Kittencal's Marinade for Grilled Steak


Ingredients


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 2 tablespoon of sauce, worcestershire


 - 2 tablespoon of vinegar, balsamic


 - 2 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 2 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 13 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Mix all the marinade ingredients together in a bowl. Pour over steaks. Cover tightly and place the steaks in the refrigerator for minimum 4 hours or even better for 24 hours. Remove the steaks from the fridge. Bring the steaks down to almost room temperature before grilling. Season steaks with steak seasoning or seasoning of choice if desired (I like to use Montreal Steak Seasoning). Grill for 6-12 minutes turning 3-4 times or until desired doneness.

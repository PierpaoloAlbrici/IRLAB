### Ingredients

 - 12 pound of cheese, cheddar

 - 13 pound of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 pinch of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 12 cup of animal fat, bacon grease

 - 12 teaspoon of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 450F. Grate cheese by hand or in food processor and place in bowl. Pulse flour, cayenne in food processor. Add butter and process until butter and flour are combined. Pulse in cheese. Turn out onto counter or cutting board and knead by hand, adding a few drops of ice water if necessary (you can wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 2 days, taking it out about a half hour before proceeding). Roll out into a rectangle about a 1/4 inch thick, on a lightly floured surface or between 2 sheets of plastic wrap, then cut into 1/2 inch wide strips as long as you like. Place on a lightly greased baking sheet and sprinkle with salt, if using. Bake until golden brown, about 5 to 8 minutes.

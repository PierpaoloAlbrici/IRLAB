### Instructions

Remove pits from dates if they have them and place them in a food processor with walnuts. Process until well mixed and ground, but not smooth. About 40 seconds. It should be a coarse texture when done. Press evenly into a 9inch tart pan with about 1/2 inch crust around rim. Set in refrigerator while making the filling. Slice apricots about 1/4 inch thick, and cook in a 10 inch skillet with honey, orange juice and cinnamon on medium low heat, until apricots become tender,and liquid is syrupy. about 10 minutes. Remove apricots and syrup from hot pan and let cool in bowl for about 1 hour so it gets fairly cool. Spread evenly over crust. It can be served right away or chilled. Make sure you store tart covered so it doesn't pick up moisture from the refrigerator.

Mango Butter


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of honey


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1/2 cup of mango nectar, canned


Instructions: 

In a small mixing bowl with a wooden spoon, beat together the honey, butter, and mango until evenly mixed. Transfer to a ramekin, smooth off the top, and serve with warm breakfast breads. If desired, spread the butter on a long sheet of plastic wrap and roll up into a cylinder. Chill or freeze and cut off 1/2 inch disks of the flavored butter as needed. Variations: substitute chopped ripe papaya for the mango, or use half mango and half papaya

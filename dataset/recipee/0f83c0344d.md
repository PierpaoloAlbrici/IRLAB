### Ingredients

 - 14 cup of honey

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 8 ounce of figs, dried, uncooked

 - 14 pound of cheese, blue

### Instructions

Cut each fig into quarters, leaving a 1/2 inch of the bottom base of the fig attached, so the figs flower out. Combine the honey and pepper in a small bowl. Gently press each fig to open, then mound with a spoonful of blue cheese and drizzle with peppered honey.

Salted Bittersweet Fudge with Toasted Walnuts


Ingredients


 - 1/4 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 14 ounce of milk, canned, condensed, sweetened


 - 1 cup of nuts, walnuts, english


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 3 cup of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022


 - 2 tablespoon of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


Instructions: 

Line an 8-inch square pan with aluminum foil. Melt the butter in a heavy medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the condensed milk and stir constantly until the mixture bubbles gently at the edges, about 3 minutes. Mix in the walnuts, vanilla and salt. Stir in the chocolate and stir gently, just until the chocolate melts. Drizzle the cream over the surface of the fudge and stir vigorously just until the fudge is smooth and glossy, but not oily. (If the mixture separates and becomes oily, transfer the fudge to the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer and beat until blended.) Transfer the mixture into the prepared pan and smooth with a spatula. Refrigerate until firm, about 3 hours. Using the foil as a guide, remove the fudge from the pan. Cut the fudge evenly into 48 squares. (Fudge can be made ahead and refrigerated up to two weeks ahead.)

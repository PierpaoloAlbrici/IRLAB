Flax Vegan Egg Substitute


Ingredients


 - 1 tablespoon of seeds, flaxseed


 - 2-3 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Simmer flax seeds and water in a saucepan for about 5 minutes (or less or more time depending on the amount you are making) or until thick, egg-like consistency has been reached. Let cool before using in a recipe. ** (About 10 minutes). This recipe makes 1 eggs worth, but it can be easily made into a larger quantity using the 1:3 ratio- for example, 1 cup ground flax seeds and 3 cups water (that would make 16 eggs worth) and will keep in the fridge for about 2 weeks. Use about 1/4 cup (which is equal to 4Tbs) egg substitute for every egg.

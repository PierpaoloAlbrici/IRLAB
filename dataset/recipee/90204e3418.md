### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of oats

 - 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/2 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 13 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of jams and preserves, apricot

 - 13 cup of nuts, almonds

### Instructions

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 8x8 pan with foil and lightly spray with a Misto or baking spray. In a medium bowl measure and combine the oats, flours, coconut and salt. Pour in the melted butter and stir until the butter has absorbed the flours and crumbles form. Press 2/3 of the oatmeal/coconut mixture into the prepared pan. Spread the rhubarb jam over top (cold jam is preferred). Sprinkle the remaining oatmeal/coconut crumbles over top of the jam and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the pan and sprinkle with sliced almonds. Return the pan to the oven to continue to bake for 10-15 minutes more. Remove once the almonds are slightly golden. Let cool completely before cutting and serving. Enjoy!

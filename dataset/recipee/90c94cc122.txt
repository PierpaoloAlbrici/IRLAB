Monastery of the Angels Peanut Brittle


Ingredients


 - 3 3/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 1/2 cup of syrups, corn, light


 - 1 1/2 cup of oil, corn, peanut, and olive


 - 14 pound of butter, without salt


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Start by preparing 3 buttered jelly roll pans, 15 1/2" X 10 1/2 " and spraying 2 or more forks with non-stick vegetable spray; set aside until ready to pour the candy mixture. Combine sugar, water and corn syrup in a large kettle; and bring to a boil while stirring constantly. Add peanuts and cook stirring, until mixture reaches 280 degrees F on a candy thermometer (soft crack stage) and peanuts turn light tan; add butter, stirring until melted; continue cooking until mixture registers 300 degrees on candy thermometer (hard crack stage). Remove mixture from heat; combine baking soda and salt and stir into candy; pour candy onto 3 warm, buttered jelly roll pans. Use forks, coated with non-stick vegetable spray, to quickly spread mixture as thinly as possible (having two cooks makes pouring and spreading the brittle easier); also note that the mixture is extremely hot and should be handled with care. Cool thoroughly, then break into pieces; store in a tightly covered container(s).

Lemon Mousse for a Crowd


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of egg, white, raw, fresh


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 cup of lemon juice, raw


 - 1 cup of syrups, corn, light


 - 3 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


Instructions: 

Bring 2 inches water to a boil in bottom of a double-boiler. In top of double-boiler, combine egg whites, sugar and lemon juice. Place over boiling water. With a large balloon whisk, whisk egg whites vigorously until smooth, airy and very thick, about 5 minutes. Add corn syrup and whisk just until smooth, then remove from heat. Transfer beaten whites to a large mixing bowl. Cover and refrigerate about 1 hour. Remove from refrigerator and add heavy cream. Using an electric mixer, whisk until thick enough to hold stiff peaks, about 2 minutes. Place in dessert cups or bowls, cover, and refrigerate 15 minutes to 1 hour before serving.

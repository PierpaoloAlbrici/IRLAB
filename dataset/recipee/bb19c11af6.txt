Blueberry-Pomegranate Granita


Ingredients


 - 2 pound of blueberries, raw


 - 8 ounce of pomegranate juice, bottled


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 3 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


Instructions: 

Combine all in a blender and process until smooth. Strain mixture and remove as much juice from the pulp as you can. Pour mixture into a shallow 9x13x2 metal or plastic container. Cover and place in the freezer for an hour. Using a fork, break up large chunks and scrape down the edges. Return mixture to freezer and let it sit for another 30 minutes. Break up the large chunks again with a fork. Repeat every 30 minutes for an hour or two, until mixture is mostly frozen. Let it freeze overnight, then stir, breaking up chunks once again. If at any time it gets too hard, let it sit on the counter for a few minutes, stir, then return to freezer. Serves 8-10. Notes: I highly recommend the whipped cream. The granita is a bit tart (for meIm sensitive to tartness), and the cream took care of that very well. And there arent a whole lot of treats that wouldnt benefit from a dollop of whipped cream. Especially freshly whipped cream.

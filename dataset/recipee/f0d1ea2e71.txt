 - 18 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

Instructions: 

In a heavy 2 quart sauce pan, melt butter over low heat. Add water, turn up heat, and bring to a boil. Slowly add cornmeal while whisking constantly. Lower heat slightly and continue to boil and stir until polenta becomes thick and pulls away from sides of pan. (about 30 minutes). Remove from heat and add parmesan cheese and pine nuts. Cool slightly (until able to handle). Grease cookie pan with half of the oil and spread evenly in pan. Rub top with remaining oil. Chill. If grilling, cut into squares (3 to 4 inches). Grill on hot grill until crisp on outside and soft and creamy on inside -- or. If baking, sprinkle with a little more cheese, and bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes, then cut into squares.

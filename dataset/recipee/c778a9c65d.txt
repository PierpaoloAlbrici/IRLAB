Instructions: 

Place the flour, white sugar, salt, yeast, milk, vanilla, and 3 tablespoons of butter into your bread machine as directed in your user's manual. Program it for the "Dough" cycle. While the dough is mixing, prepare the filling by mixing the 3/4 cup brown sugar and cinnamon together. Let the 6 tablespoons of butter come to room temperature. Grease the bottom and sides of a 13"x9" baking pan. When the dough cycle is nearly finished, make the caramel topping by combining the 1/3 cup butter, 1 cup brown sugar, and corn syrup in a small pan over moderate heat. Heat and stir just until the syrup is dissolved, then pour it into the baking pan and spread it out. Sprinkle the chopped pecans over the caramel. When the dough cycle ends, remove the dough and place on a lightly floured surface. Roll it out to make a 12" by 15" rectangle. Spread the softened butter across the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on all sides. Sprinkle the cinnamon mixture over the butter. Roll up the dough like a jelly roll, lengthwise. Pinch the seam closed. Cut the dough into 1 1/2" sections and place them in the baking pan, close together, with the spiral cut down. Cover the buns tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. In the morning, take the pan out of the refrigreator while you preheat the oven to 350 degrees. After the dough has been out of the refrigerator about 20-30 minutes, bake at 350 degrees for about 30-35 minutes, or until buns are nicely browned on top. Remove from the oven, then place a wire rack on top the pan. Place another baking sheet or pan over that. While firmly holding these three together, flip the buns over, being careful not to let the hot caramel drip on you. Let the buns cool 20-30 minutes before serving.

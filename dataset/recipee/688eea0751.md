 - 1/2 cup of sugars, brown

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside. In a medium bowl, add flour, baking soda and salt. Stir well and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, add brown sugar, granulated sugar, peanut butter, butter and vanilla extract. Beat until combined. Add the egg and beat until blended. Gradually add in the flour mixture and mix until just combined. Fold in the candy corn. Scoop about 2 tablespoon sized scoops of cookie dough onto prepared pans, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Slightly, flatten cookies with a fork or the back of a spoon. Note: These cookies will spread and flatten out. Bake for 8 minutes or until the bottom of cookies are lightly brown. Remove baking sheets from oven and set on a rack. Let cookies cool on baking sheets for two minutes then place them onto a cooling rack. Store cookies in an airtight container for up to 5 days or store in the freezer for up to 3 months.

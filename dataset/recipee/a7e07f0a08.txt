Carrot Fries


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of carrots, raw


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


 - 14 cup of dill weed, fresh


Instructions: 

Slice the carrots into french fry-sized pieces and place on a cookie sheet. Melt butter and pour over carrots. Chop dill and sprinkle over carrots. Bake 400 degrees for about a half hour, adjusting cooking time if you want the carrots softer or "crispier".

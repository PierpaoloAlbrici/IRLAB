### Instructions

In a saucepan cook the onion in the oil over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until it is softened, add the flour, and cook the mixture, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in the broth, bring the mixture to a boil, stirring, and add the cucumber. Bring the mixture to a blender, and puree it with the tofu and the lemon juice until the mixture is smooth.

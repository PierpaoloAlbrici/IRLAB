[bc95d1d038](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/e-z-cream-biscuits/)

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 1/2 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and cream just until blended. You should have a sticky dough. Use a large spoon to scrape the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead the dough once or twice, then pat or roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut into circles using a biscuit cutter. Place on a baking sheet, spacing 1/2 inch apart. If you like drop biscuits, you can skip the this part and just drop spoonfuls of the dough onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the bottoms and tops are golden brown, about 15 minutes.

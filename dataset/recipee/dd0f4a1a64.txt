Fresh Lime Sherbet


Ingredients


 - 1 tablespoon of lime juice, raw


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 18 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 23 cup of lime juice, raw


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 teaspoon of alcoholic beverage, distilled, vodka, 80 proof


 - 23 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


Instructions: 

The night before, place ice cream maker bowl in the freezer. In the bowl of your food processor, combine lime zest, sugar and salt. Pulse 10-15 times, or until sugar is damp and fragrant. Combine lime juice and water in a large measuring cup, and with the food processor running, slowly add the juice/water mixture in a steady stream. Process for about 1 minute, or until the sugar has dissolved completely. Pour mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a freezer-safe bowl to strain out the lime zest. Mix in vodka and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Place bowl in your freezer for 40 minutes, or until mixture is very cold (about 40 degrees F on an instant read thermometer). Dont let the mixture freeze in there! Add heavy cream to a medium bowl and (by hand) whisk until soft peaks form, about 4 minutes. Remove juice mixture from the freezer and, whisking constantly, slowly pour juice mixture (down the edge of the bowl rather than in the center) into the cream in a steady stream. Immediately add mixture to ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturers instructions. (Mine took about 1520 minutes to reach soft-serve consistency.) Transfer the sherbet to an airtight container and press a piece of plastic wrap directly against the surface. Freeze for at least 3 hours (or until firm) before serving. Makes about 1 quart.

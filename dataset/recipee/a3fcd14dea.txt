Depression Era Homemade Bread


Ingredients


 - 5 pound of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 6 tablespoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 5 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 5 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Mix all ingredients together in a bowl (we dont own a bowl big enough to do this recipe in one bowl, so I halve the recipe into 2 bowls). Use your handsit will be much easier. After you have mixed everything together, take the dough out of the bowls, clean up the bowls (make sure to dry them) and spray with cooking spray (the spray will make taking the dough out of the bowls easier after it has risen). Cover and leave in a warm place to rise. After the dough has risen for desired amount of time, take dough out of the bowls and knead on a clean counter surface to get all the air bubbles out. Separate dough into pieces and place into sprayed bread pans. Cover and allow to rise again. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes (mine needed more than 30 minutes though).

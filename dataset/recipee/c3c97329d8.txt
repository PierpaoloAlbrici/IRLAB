Microwave Dulce De Leche


Ingredients


 - 7 ounce of milk, canned, condensed, sweetened


 - 7 ounce of milk, canned, condensed, sweetened


Instructions: 

Pour sweetened condensed milk into a 1-quart microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on MEDIUM for two minutes. CAREFULLY remove from microwave and whisk. (I did this using two oven mitts to move the bowl, un-mitted my left hand to hold the whisk, and used my right hand, still in the mitt, to steady the bowl as I whisked. ). Return to microwave and repeat, heating two minutes at a time and whisking until mixture looks curdled. Remove from microwave and whisk again for a dulce de leche sauce. For a candy texture repeat cooking and stirring one more time. Cool and serve.

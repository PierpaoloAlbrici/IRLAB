Amaranth Oat Bread Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of oats


 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 3 tablespoon of honey


 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


Instructions: 

Bring the oat flakes, water, and salt to a boil, cook till thick and creamy. Cold to room temperature. Combine the next ingredients and let set till bubbly (10 min). Then add in the flours. Knead, let rise for 1 1/2 hrs. Knead again, let rise second time, punch down and form into loaves. Let rise, bake at 350 degrees F for 60 min, till crust is golden and bread tests done. NOTES : One can replace part of the wheat flour with amaranth flour in any recipe. Try to use 1/4 amaranth flour, and see what happens. I use this method with lots of different ingredients, just to see how they work!

Can't Get Enough of My Apple Crumble!


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of apples, raw, with skin


 - 1 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground


 - 18 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 cup of oats


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 cup of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


 - 23 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1 1/2 liter of ice creams, vanilla


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 375F. Combine all "The Apple" ingredients in a large bowl. Combine all "The Crumble" ingredients in a smaller bowl, and cut them together: (Use a pastry blender, or just use two butter knives and criss-cross them in the middle of the mix and pull outward - repeating the motion over and over. ). Place "The Apple" in a greased casserole. Sprinkle "The Crumble" onto "The Apple". Bake 35 minutes - while you're enjoying dinner. Serve hot with only French Vanilla Ice Cream on top - nothing else will do! OPTIONS: Sprinkle walnuts on top, or reduce the margarine to 2 tablespoons but adding 1/4 cup of peanut butter to "The Crumble".

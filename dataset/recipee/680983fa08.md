### Ingredients

 - 4 1/2 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 2 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 12 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of nuts, pistachio nuts, raw

 - 34 cup of egg, white, raw, fresh

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 ounce of candies, semisweet chocolate

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 400-degrees, and line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Blend sugar and almonds in food processor until nuts are ground to powder, scraping down sides of bowl often, about 4 minutes. Add flour and blend 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl and mix in pistachios. In a separate bowl, beat egg whites and salt until stiff but not dry. Fold nut mixture into whites in 4 additions (batter will be thick). Spoon batter by generous tablespoonfuls onto prepared sheets, spacing mounds 1 1/2-inches apart. Bake cookies 1 sheet at a a time until dry and cracked on top, about 10 minutes. Melt chocolate over double-boiler or in microwave, stirring until melted. Dip each cookie halfway into chocolate, shaking off excess. Place on foil-lined baking sheets, or on waxed paper- chill for 30 minutes. (Can be made 3 days ahead. Store between sheets of waxed paper in airtight container and refrigerate.) Serve at room temperature.

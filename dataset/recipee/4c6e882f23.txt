Grilled Asparagus with Lemon and Olive Oil


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of asparagus, raw


 - 3 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 3/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

Preheat the grill to medium. In a shallow baking dish, toss the asparagus with the oil to coat well. Add the salt, and pepper and toss. Place the asparagus on the grill in a single layer, and cook, turning, until marked and tender, about 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a platter, sprinkle with the lemon juice and drizzle with olive oil, to taste. Cover with aluminum foil and let sit for 5 minutes before serving. *NOTE: Large asparagus can be placed directly on the grill; smaller ones may fall through during cooking. If cooking thin asparagus, use a grill basket.

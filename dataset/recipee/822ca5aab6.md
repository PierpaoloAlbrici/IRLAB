### Ingredients

 - 60 ml of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

 - 60 ml of syrup, maple, canadian

 - 90 g of oats

 - 70 g of oats

 - 45 g of seeds, pumpkin and squash seeds, whole, roasted, without salt

 - 35 g of cranberries, dried, sweetened

 - 30 g of seeds, flaxseed

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin, raw

 - 110 g of pumpkin, raw

 - 2 tablespoon of applesauce, canned, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid (includes usda commodity)

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to gas 4 / 180C / 350F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper Slightly warm the coconut oil and syrup together in a microwavable bowl Add the dry ingredients and stir in so everything is coated in the oil/syrup mixture Now add the pumpkin and apple purees and mix again well Roll into ping pong sized balls and flatten down on the baking sheet (these cookies won't spread) Bake for 20 - 25 minutes (depends on how thin you press them) then let cool on the tray before storing in an airtight container I like to use this flaxseed mix available from Holland & Barretts, larger Tesco stores and also online. It's a resealable pack that stores in the fridge but it needs to be used within 6 weeks or the goodness is lost from the flax

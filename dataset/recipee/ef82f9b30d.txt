Crispy Noodles


Ingredients


 - 250 ml of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 100 g of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


Instructions: 

Heat the oil in a deep heavy-bottomed saucepan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. Add the rice noodles to the oil - They will puff up immediately, so be ready! After a few seconds, carefully remove the cooked noodles from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain onto kitchen paper. Serve warm in a large bowl.

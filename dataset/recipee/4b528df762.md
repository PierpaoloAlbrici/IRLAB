 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 cup of honey

### Instructions

Mix first 6 ingredients in large bowl. Add the rest of the ingredients to a pot over low medium heat and heat until thoroughly combined. Pour liquid mixture over dry ingredients and stir with spoon until combined and moist. Spread over parchment paper covered cookie sheet and bake at 325 for 25-30 minutes to desired crunchiness. You may want to break up the granola with a spatula about half way through. Remember as it cools, it will harden and become more crunchy. This is DELICIOUS with some homemade almond milk!

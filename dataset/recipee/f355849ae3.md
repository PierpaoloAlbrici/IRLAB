### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Cream together softened butter and sugar until very well incorporated. DO NOT substitute. You MUST use butter and no sugar alternatives. Add in flour and mix until dough forms into a ball. Try not to over mix. Place dough onto plastic wrap and form into a roll 2 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter. Wrap roll and chill in the fridge for a couple hours or until firm. Slice roll into 1/4 inch slices and place onto lightly greased cookie sheet about 1/2 inch apart. These should not spread too much as they cook. Bake for about 10 minutes or until just barely golden around the edges. Cool for a couple minutes and then gently remove from pan and cool on a cookie rack. They are light, crisp and decadently delicate once cooled. NOTES: IF you want to be fancy--you can drizzle dark chocolate on top once they are done or dip them to get something similar to a good peperidge farm cookie. I have also been lazy and formed circles by hand instead of chilling. You can also add a couple drops of food coloring for a fun twist.

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of strawberries, raw

 - 2 cup of mango nectar, canned

 - 12 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow

 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

 - 12 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 12 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

The Filling : Preheat oven to 375F. Place fruit into a large bowl and toss well with the flour, sugar and lemon juice. Pour into a 2-quart ovenproof casserole or other dish. It is best if the fruit fills the dish but doesn't rise above the edges. The Topping: Whisk together flour, cornmeal, sugar, salt and baking powder. Grate in frozen butter and mix lightly with fingertips. Pour in milk and stir until mixture comes together and forms a rough dough. Place spoonfuls of the dough on top of the fruit evenly covering it. Bake until the fruit is bubbling and the topping is golden, about 45 minutes. Serve warm.

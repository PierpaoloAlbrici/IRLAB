### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of apricots, dried, sulfured, uncooked

 - 2 cup of dates, deglet noor

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

 - 1 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

### Instructions

Finely chop the apricots and dates, then combine in a 2-quart mixing bowl. Add the honey and blend thoroughly into the mixture. Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper. Place the coconut in a round cake pan. Spoon out tablespoonfuls of the apricot-date mixture and roll into balls in your hands. Then roll the balls in the coconut, coating them completely. Place each ball in a paper candy cup. Between layers of waxed paper in a tightly covered container, the balls will keep for 3 weeks in the refrigerator. They are best eaten at room temperature. Substitute dried peaches, dried pears, or raisins for the apricots.

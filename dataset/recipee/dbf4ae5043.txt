Satay Ayam (Chicken Satay)


Ingredients


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 2 tablespoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 1 tablespoon of molasses


 - 2 teaspoon of lime juice, raw


 - 2 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

Combine the garlic, salt and pepper in a deep bowl and mash them to a paste with the back of a spoon. Mix in the soy sauce, molasses and lime juice. Add the chicken cubes and toss until they are evenly coated. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Remove the chicken from the marinade and thread it tightly, 4 or 5 pieces at a time, on small skewers (preferably Oriental wooden skewers about 6 inches (15 cm) long). Brush the oil evenly over the chicken. Cook over charcoal (traditional) or under the kitchen broiler for 5 to 10 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is crisp and brown. Serve at once, with the meat still on the skewers, accompanied by katjang sauce presented separately in a bowl.

### Ingredients

 - 1 teaspoon of animal fat, bacon grease

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

### Instructions

Grease a cookie sheet with butter. Set aside. Preheat oven to 325 F. In a medium sized bowl, use your hands to combine the oat flour, coconut milk and honey. Knead until all is combined. If dough is still sticky, you may add more oat flour. Lightly sprinkle your surface with oat flour. Roll dough out into 1/4 inch thickness. Use a round cookie cutter (1 1/2 inch diameter is what I used) to cut cookies. Put cookies onto your prepared cookie sheet, spacing them an inch or so apart. Bake for 15 minutes or until golden.

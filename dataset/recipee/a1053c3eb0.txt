Diva Diabetic's Savory Almonds


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, onion powder


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place almonds on the baking sheet and toss with onion, garlic powder, salt and oil. Make sure almonds are well coated and in one even layer. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, opening the oven to shake the cookie sheet to turn the almonds over every few minutes. Make sure the almonds are in a single layer when you return them to the oven. Allow almonds to cool and store in plastic baggies in 1/4 cup portions, to take with you on the go, as a healthy snack!

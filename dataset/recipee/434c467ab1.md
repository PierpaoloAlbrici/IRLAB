### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of cornstarch

 - 1/2 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 3/4 cup of butter, without salt

### Instructions

1. Sift together corn starch, sugar and flour. With a wooden spoon, blend in butter until a soft, smooth dough forms. 2. Shape into 1-inch (2.5 cm) balls. If dough is too soft to handle, cover and chill for 30 to 60 minutes. Place 1 1/2 inches (4 cm) apart on ungreased baking sheets; flatten with a lightly floured fork. Alternatively, roll dough to 1/4-inch (6 mm) thickness; cut into shapes with cookie cutters. 3. Decorate with candied cherries, coloured sprinkles or nuts, if desired. 4. Bake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Cool on wire rack. Variation: to make crescents, add 1/2 cup (125 mL) ground almonds or hazelnuts to the flour mixture. Shape into logs about 1/2 inch (1 cm) thick and 3 inches (7 cm) long. Curve into crescent shapes. When baked and cooled, dip ends in melted chocolate.

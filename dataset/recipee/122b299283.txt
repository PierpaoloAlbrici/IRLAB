Homemade Ricotta Cheese


Ingredients


 - 1 gallon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 quart of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Add the milk and the buttermilk to a heavy-bottomed pot. Bring the mixture to about 180 degrees F. Use a wooden spoon to occasionally stir the liquids so the curds dont stick to the bottom of the pot. Once the liquids have reached about 180 degrees, you will start to see the curds and whey separate. Turn off the heat and let them do their thing. Using a mesh spoon, start removing the curds from the pot and placing them into your cheesecloth-lined colander. Continue this process until you have removed each precious curd from the pot and all that is left is the whey. Let the curds drain for about 25 minutes. Once the curds have drained in the colander, gather the ends of the cheese cloth to make a pouch of the curds. Hang it to dry for another 30 minutes. Dont squeeze the pouch ... I know its temping, but it will harden the curds. Once drained, remove the curds from the cheese cloth and season with salt.

[0a63dce38c](http://www.food.com/recipe/horseradish-canned-30959)

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of horseradish, prepared

 - 12 cup of vinegar, distilled

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

grated horseradish (trim skin with veggie peeler, wash and grind in a meat grinder or do in food processor) (I hear wearing goggles helps your eyes) Mix thoroughly with vinegar and salt using amounts as needed and pack into hot sterile jars. I usually process in a hot water bath for 10 min for pints. It is best to still store in the fridge, I think for colouring. If you want it creamy a client told me to put the whole mixture back into the food processor and puree a bit, I havent tried it yet but he said that is how the big companies do it. The heat all depends on the growing season and sometimes it gets hotter after stored.

Boboli Pizza Crust


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 1 tablespoon of vital wheat gluten


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1/2 tablespoon of honey


 - 2 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1/4 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard


Instructions: 

Put wheat flour into a mixing bowl with yeast, gluten, and salt. Combine water, honey and oil. Dissolve well. Pour into the wheat flour, mix well, and let it sit for 10 minutes. Add all-purpose flour, starting with 2 cups all-purpose flour and adding one cup at a time, up to 2 1/2 cups total. Stop adding flour when dough clings to the hook and cleans the sides of the bowl. Knead for 5 minutes. Dough should be smooth, elastic, and feel wet, but not sticky. Oil the top of the dough, cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm, draft-free place for 30 minutes. Take dough out, punch it down, and let it rest on the counter, covered, for 10 minutes. Sprinkle cornmeal on a pizza stone. Place the dough on it and roll into a 14 circle. Take a chopstick or similar instrument and poke holes in the dough, about 2 apart. This keeps the pizza uniform in shape without huge bubbles in it. Spritz lightly with water and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake in a 400 degrees F oven for 1520 minutes, covering it lightly with foil during the last 5 minutes to prevent over browning. Put desired pizza toppings on and bake for an additional 10 minutes or until cheese is brown and bubbly.

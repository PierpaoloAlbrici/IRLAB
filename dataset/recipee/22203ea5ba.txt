Apple Pie Filling (To Freeze Or Can) Recipe


Ingredients


 - 4 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground


 - 10 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 cup of cornstarch


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 24 cup of apples, raw, with skin


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 3 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

Blend sugar, nutmeg, cornstarch, salt, cinnamon. Add in water and cook until clear. Add in apples and lemon juice and cook until apples are soft. Pack in jars/containers. To make pie, make crust and bake. Into prepared crust, put thawed filling and bake till warmed through. Crumb topping can be added before baking filling if you want (I use sugar, cinnamon, margarine and minced pecans.) I found which the thickener (the flour, water, etc. mix which is cooked first) made a lot more than could be used up by 24 c of apples. I think I got a total of 8-10 large containers (I use empty 32 ounce yogurt containers). One of these containers was just sufficient for a 9 in pie. I also used (do not tell anybody) prepared pie shells just fine with this filling. I also used a large nonstick pot to cook this in and had very little problem with sticking at medium to medium high temperature.

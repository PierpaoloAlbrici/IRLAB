Dewey's Simple Fruit Smoothie


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 cup of pineapple, raw, all varieties


 - 1 1/4 cup of orange juice, raw


 - 1 cup of yogurt, greek, plain, nonfat


 - 14 cup of oats


 - 1 teaspoon of honey


Instructions: 

Combine all ingredients in blender on medium speed until smooth (about 2 minutes.) Adjust juice for a thicker or soupier smoothie to your preference. I normally funnel into 2 empty 16.9 oz. water bottles and chill in the freezer for approximately 30 minutes. Excellent on the go.

Vegan "overnight" Pancakes


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 3 cup of soymilk, original and vanilla, unfortified


 - 12 tablespoon of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of egg substitute, powder


 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

To make the batter, first combine the dry ingredients together in a large bowl, then mix in the soy milk and melted butter or margarine. (Earth Balance is a good vegan, non-hydrogenated margarine. It comes as a "buttery spread," or "buttery sticks. "). Cover the bowl and leave on the counter at room temperature at least 8 hours, or overnight. In the morning, mix the egg replacer with water until creamy or foamy. Fold the "egg" into the batter. Heat the griddle over medium-high heat. Spray the griddle with a light mist of oil, and ladle the batter onto the griddle in groups of 3-4. Cook 1-2 minutes until bubbles appear on the surface and the underside is golden brown. Flip the pancakes and cook other side for about 2 minutes. Serve with pure maple syrup, or a fruit syrup (i.e. blueberry, raspberry, apricot, strawberry).

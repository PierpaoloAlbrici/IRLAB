### Ingredients

 - 23 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 tablespoon of honey

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

In a cup, microwave water, butter and honey for a 30 seconds (enough to melt butter). In a bowl measure out your flour. Pour water mixture over flour and mix with rubber spatula Knead with hands. If dough is too dry add a little water, if too wet add a little flour. (however this shouldn't be necessary). Dough should form about 5 small balls. Set each one in the bowl. Cover with a damp cloth/ paper towel. Let rest 10 minutes. One by one, flatten each ball between your palms then set it on wax paper and roll out your tortillas as thin as you can. Heat up your griddle or skillet over low heat. Do not grease. Carefully peel your tortilla from the paper and place into hot skillet. Let sit in skillet for 2-5 seconds, then begin to flip repeatedly to prevent burning. Allowing about 5-8 seconds per side until dough becomes dull in color and small golden bubbles appear on the tortilla - this means they are ready! Remove from heat and enjoy them warm or let them cool. They can be refrigerator stored in air tight bag - Ready to use for all your favorite snack wrap combination. (If tortillas seem too stiff taken straight out of refrigerator, they can be microwaved for a few seconds to soften them again). Enjoy!

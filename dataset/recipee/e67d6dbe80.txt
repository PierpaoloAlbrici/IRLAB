Maple Pecan Pie Popcorn


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 1/2 cup of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 8 cup of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)

Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. In a small saucepan, cook syrup and brown sugar over medium heat, whisking frequently, for 5 minutes. Whisk in margarine and salt until slightly thickened, about 5 more minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Mix popcorn and nuts and spread on parchment-lined baking sheet.

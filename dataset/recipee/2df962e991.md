In a food processor, process flour, sugar (if using) and butter with on/off turns (about 2-3 seconds at a time) until the mixture begins to look like coarse oatmeal. Combine the ginger ale with vinegar, and add through feed tube while machine is running; process just until the dough begins to gather in a mass around the blades (about 8-10 seconds, do not overprocess! ). Dump the dough onto the counter. Gather up all the dough then shape into a flat disc. Wrap disc in plastic wrap and chill in fridge for a minimum of 30 minutes or up to overnight. Dough may be frozen wrapped in plastic wrap then tightly in foil.

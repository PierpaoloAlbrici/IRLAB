### Ingredients

 - 225 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 100 g of sugars, powdered

 - 325 g of butter, without salt

 - 150 g of sugars, brown

 - 397 g of milk, canned, condensed, sweetened

 - 200 g of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to gas mark 2. Line the base of a 20cm square tin with baking paper, and grease the sides. Sift flour into a bowl with a pinch of salt. Stir in caster sugar and rub in 175g of the butter until the mixture becomes clumpy (i.e. like a sticky dough). Transfer to the tin and press firmly with back of spoon. Bake for 35-40 minutes until pale golden brown. Cool in the tin. Put remaining butter and brown sugar in a saucepan and stir over low heat until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved. (Don't let it burn!) Add condensed milk and stir over a very low heat until it simmers. Continue to simmer the mixture for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. The mixture will look thicker, take it off the heat and pour over the shortbread you previously made. Leave to set for 30 minutes, although an hour would be ideal. Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of gently simmering water. Pour onto the caramel and leave to set for an hour or so. Slice into 16 squares or 8 slices and ENJOY!

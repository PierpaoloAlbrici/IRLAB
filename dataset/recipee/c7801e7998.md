Combine the sugar and cocoa in a saucepan to get rid of lumps. Stir in 2 cups of water or milk and put it over medium-high heat. (Feel free to make part of this coffee if you like ( *whistles innocently*) Bring to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes. Take off heat and stir in the chocolate. Stir until its melted. Let the mixture cool, and then refrigerate until cold. Pour into ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturers directions. The one I used was so easy: pour in, turn on, wait for magic to happen. Store in freezer for extra firmness.

The Super Bowl ... of Popcorn


Ingredients


 - 13 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 teaspoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 1 drop of sauce, ready-to-serve, pepper, tabasco


 - 2 quart of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)


 - 12 ounce of onions, raw


Instructions: 

Add soy sauce and Tabasco to 1/3 cup melted butter. Put popped popcorn & assorted snacks of choice in a large bowl. Pour butter/soy mixture over the popcorn/snacks combo & toss. (NOTE: When selecting your assorted snack items, I suggest you avoid anything already salted or seasoned like salted pretzels, nuts, shoestring potatoes, etc. ). Sprinkle w/dry onion soup mix seasoning & toss again. (NOTE: Some salt content has already been included in the butter & soy sauce. Since salt is a matter of personal preference, I suggest using a small strainer to collect the dry onion components of the soup mix, set them aside to later recombine w/the remaining soup mix & gradually sprinkle the seasoning part of the soup mix to the popcorn/snack mix per your personal taste. ). Spread mixture in a jelly roll pan (15 1/2 x 10 1/2 x 1-in) & bake in a 350F oven for 8-10 min, stirring once. Serve when fully cooled & store remains in a relatively airtight container with a snap-on lid, but you're not likely to need it!

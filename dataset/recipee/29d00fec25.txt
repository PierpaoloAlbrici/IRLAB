Chipotle Butter Roasted Broccoli


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of broccoli, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cumin seed


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, chili powder


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/2 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 450 F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Wash broccoli crowns and cut into florets. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl and heat it in the microwave until melted (just a few seconds at a time). Add the cumin, chipotle chili powder, salt, and sugar to the melted butter and stir to combine. Pour butter mixture into a large bowl. Toss the broccoli florets in the butter mixture. Be sure that each piece of broccoli gets some of the butter mixture. Place broccoli evenly spaced on the foil-lined baking sheet. Bake broccoli for 10-15 minutes, stirring halfway through. Broccoli should be tender and lightly browned.

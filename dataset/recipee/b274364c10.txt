Maple-Bacon Biscuit Bake


Ingredients


 - 12 pound of bacon, meatless


 - 13 cup of sugars, brown


 - 14 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 14 cup of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 14 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 475F Thoroughly grease an 8" square or 9" round pan. Syrup: Chop the cooked bacon into 1/2" pieces. Combine the bacon with the remaining syrup ingredients, stirring until well combined. Spread in the bottom of the prepared pan. Biscuits: Whisk the dry ingredients together in a bowl. Work in the butter until the mixture is crumbly; some larger, pea-sized pieces of butter may remain intact. Add the milk or buttermilk, stirring to make a sticky dough. Drop the dough in heaping tablespoonfuls atop the syrup in the pan. A tablespoon cookie scoop, slightly overfilled, works well here. Bake the biscuits on the middle rack of the oven for 10 minutes. Turn the oven off, and leave them in the oven for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, until they're golden brown. Remove the biscuits from the oven, and IMMEDIATELY turn the pan over onto a serving plate. If you leave the biscuits sitting in the pan after you remove it from the oven, the bacon/maple topping will start to set up and it will be difficult to get it out of the pan. Lift off the pan, and scrape any syrup left in the pan onto the biscuits. Pull biscuits apart to serve.

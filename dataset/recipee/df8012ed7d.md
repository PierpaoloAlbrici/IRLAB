[df8012ed7d](http://www.food.com/recipe/corn-oil-pastry-13846)

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 12 cup of oil, corn, peanut, and olive

 - 14 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Mix flour and salt together, then gently mix in oil, then water, with a fork. Mixture should be moist. Place half the dough on a sheet of wax paper (if you slightly dampen the bottom of the wax paper it won't slide around on the countertop) and cover the dough with a second sheet of wax paper. With a rolling pin, roll the dough out to fit your pie plate. Peel off the top layer of wax paper; place pie plate over pastry and invert so pie dough is evenly in pan. Pull off the wax paper and trim dough. This recipe makes two pie crusts.

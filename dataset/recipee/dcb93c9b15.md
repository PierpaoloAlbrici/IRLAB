### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 cup of cornmeal, degermed, unenriched, yellow

 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of soup, beef broth or bouillon canned, ready-to-serve

 - 13 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine the beef or chicken broth base with the water to make a very concentrated broth. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, broth, and oil. Work (with hands may be easiest) until it forms fairly evenly mixed dough. Add more water if it seems too crumbly. Roll out to 1/4" with a rolling pin on a floured surface. Sprinkle with flour as necessary to prevent sticking. Cut out shapes with a cookie cutter of your choice. Re-combine scraps and roll out again to make more. Place shapes on a nonstick cookie sheet and bake approximately 20 minutes, or until lightly browned.

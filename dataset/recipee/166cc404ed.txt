Teri's Buttercream Frosting for Banana Nut Bread


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of sugars, powdered


 - 1/4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 3/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1/4 teaspoon of bananas, raw


 - 1/2 cup of butter, salted


Instructions: 

Beat all ingredients (except milk add this a little at a time to get the consistency you want) with electric mixer 2 minutes, scraping bowl often For a fun and intrusting twist add 1 chopped banana and 1/2cup finally chopped nuts (what ever kind you used in your bread). If you do add these remember that you will need to add more powdered sugar to thicken it up and maybe a dash more vanilla and/or banana extract for flavor. This recipe goes great on my banana bread recipe, Teri's Banana Bread) Covers multiple loaves of banana bread. contributed by Teri aka intofrogs

### Ingredients

 - 8 pound of pork, fresh, loin, country-style ribs, separable lean only, raw

 - 14 cup of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, thyme, dried

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, rosemary, dried

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Place beef, fat-side up, in a lightly oiled, shallow roasting pan. In a small bowl, stir Dijon with oil, thyme, pepper, rosemary and salt. Spread mixture evenly over fat and sides of meat. Coat ends lightly. Do no coat bottom. Let stand uncovered until meat comes to room temperature, about 2 hours. Preheat oven to 350. Roast beef, uncovered in center of oven until meat thermometer inserted in centre of meat reads 135F (57C) for medium rare, about 20 minutes per pound. It is best to start checking temperature of meat after it has roasted for 1 3/4 hours. Remove to a cutting board and cover loosely with a tent of foil. Let stand at least 15 minutes before slicing.

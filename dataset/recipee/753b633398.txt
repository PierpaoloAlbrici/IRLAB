Instructions: 

Use your bread maker: Put everything into the bread maker and start the dough course. Put the yeast in the designated compartment. Leave it up to the bread maker until the first rising. After it has risen the first time: Since my bread maker is only for 1 loaf of bread, it overflowed. If it begins to overflow during the rising process, remove the lid of the bread maker and cover it with plastic wrap instead. Remove from the case and punch down the dough. Divide the dough into two portions using a scraper. Form each portion into round balls, cover with plastic wrap, and rest for 15 minutes. After letting them rest, they should have expanded a little. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough until about 30 cm long. Fold it into thirds and then roll it up starting with the side closest you. Tightly seal the seams closed. Do the same for the other portion. Place into the bread pan with the seam side down. Spray the dough with water, cover with a lid, and let them rise a second time for about 30 minutes. When they have risen so that they are only 2 cm from the top of the pan, they are done rising Close the lid and bake in a preheated 200C oven for 30 minutes. After it has baked, remove from the pan and let it cool on a cooling rack. It's done.

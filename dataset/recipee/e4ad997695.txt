Canned Tomatoes (Vine Ripened Tomatoes in Tomato Juice)


Ingredients


 - 3 3/4 cup of tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 14 cup of tomatoes, red, ripe, raw, year round average


Instructions: 

Wash tomatoes, place in boiling water for three minutes or until skin slips off, plunge in cold water and peel. Put cored and peeled tomatoes in sterilized jars filling 3/4 full. To each jar add 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon sugar and 2 tablespoons lemon juice. Fill rest of the jar with tomato juice leaving a one inch head space, (about 1/4 cup of tomato juice per quart it depends on how full your jar, you may need more or possibly less). I use heated tomato juice. Remove air bubbles and clean rim. Seal and process for 22 minutes. Please see note in the introductory when it comes to processing times. This recipe works for cut tomatoes as well.

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wild rice, raw

 - 1 cup of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw

 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 12 cup of carrots, raw

 - 1 cup of beans, snap, green, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, brown

 - 12 cup of pineapple juice, canned or bottled, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid

 - 13 cup of raisins, seeded

 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 12 cup of cherries, sweet, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, thyme, dried

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Place 1/2 cup of water into a shallow skillet over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and add the baby carrots and cook for 4 minutes. (I like my vegetables rather toothy, if you prefer softer cook an additional minute.) If the water fully evaporates, add just 1 or 2 tablespoons more. Add the green beans and brown sugar to the carrots and cook an additional 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix together all of the salad ingredients except the tomatoes. Mix the dressing together in a small bowl. Pour on salad and toss. Add tomatoes and toss a bit more. (Tomatoes are tossed later as they can become a little bruised and mushed). Chill the salad at least 1 hour, but you can make this a day (24 hours) ahead. It ages quite well.

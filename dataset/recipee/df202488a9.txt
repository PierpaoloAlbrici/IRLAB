Quick Breakfast Oatmeal


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 23 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 1 cup of oats


 - 12 cup of raisins, seeded


Instructions: 

In a 8 oz container (e.g. an empty cool whip container works great), combine the water and dry milk until fully incorporated. Or, substitute 2 cups of milk. Add the cinnamon, brown sugar, oats, and fruit. Stir to combine. Cover and store in refrigerator overnight, or use immediately. When ready to use, microwave for 1 minute. Substitute other fruits according to your taste. I have used other dried fruits, or you could use a peeled, diced baking apple.

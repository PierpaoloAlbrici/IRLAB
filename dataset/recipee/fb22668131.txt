Sweet & Peppery Jerky "sludge"


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 pound of sauce, fish, ready-to-serve


 - 1 pound of sugars, brown


 - 14 cup of salt, table


 - 14 cup of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 13 cup of sauce, teriyaki, ready-to-serve


 - 4 tablespoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, onion powder


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


Instructions: 

In large bowl combine all ingredients until thoroughly mixed. This will build muscle! (I use my stand mixer. ). Slice meat thinly, about 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Fillet trout, leaving skin on. If using beef, it is easier to slice thinly while still partially frozen. Smoosh a thin layer of the sugar mixture into bottom of a baking dish and lay meat slices or fish fillets over. Keep layering, ending with the last of the sugar mixture. Don't worry if all the meat isn't completely covered. The marinade will liquify somewhat overnight. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, 12 hours. Next day rinse meat very lightly, just to get the chunks off, leaving a sugary glaze. FOR DEHYDRATOR:. Place meat on trays and dehydrate 160* for approximately 6 hours, checking for desired doneness at about 5 hours. FOR SMOKER:. Allow meat to dry and form the pellicle uncovered in the refrigerator for approximately 2 - 4 hours. Place in smoker and smoke for approximately 4 hours, checking for desired doneness at about 3 hours.

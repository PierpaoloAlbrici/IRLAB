### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 1 cup of wheat germ, crude

 - 14 cup of oil, corn, peanut, and olive

 - 18 cup of honey

 - 14 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Measure and mix flour and wheatgerm. Measure and add three liquids. Stir throughly till mixture comes away from sides of the bowl. Form into two balls. You can hold, refrigerate, or freeze the dough for later. Flatten balls on a cookie sheet or baking pan. Stone or non-stick surfaces work well. If not "unstick"--sprinkle the baking surface with cornmeal or line it with aluminum foil. Bake for 20 minutes. Let cool several minutes--bread will be very hot.

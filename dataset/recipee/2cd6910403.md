### Ingredients

 - 3/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1/4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1/2 ounce of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Combine water and milk in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook and sprinkle yeast on top. Set aside to rest until mixture bubbles, about 5 minutes. (If mixture does not bubble, either the liquid was not at the correct temperature or the yeast is old.) Combine flour and salt in a large bowl and whisk to aerate and break up any lumps. When yeast is ready, add flour and mix over lowest speed until dough just starts to come together and looks shredded, about 2 minutes. Increase speed to medium and continue to mix until dough is elastic and smooth, about 5 to 7 minutes. Gather dough into a ball, place in a large, oiled mixing bowl, and turn to coat. Cover with a clean, damp dishtowel, and let rest in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 30 to 40 minutes. Once the dough has risen, punch it down, then shape and bake it as desired.

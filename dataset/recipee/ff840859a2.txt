Chocolate Biscuit Oat Squares


Ingredients


 - 10 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1/2 cup of candies, caramels


 - 14 ounce of butter, without salt


 - 4 tablespoon of oats


 - 2 tablespoon of oat bran, raw


Instructions: 

1. Melt the chocolate and butter in the microwave on high for about 30 seconds. Remove and give it a good stir. The residual heat will melt off any remaining bits. 2. Once everything is melted, stir in the caramel, dulce de leche or honey. Set aside. 3. In another bowl, roughly crush the biscuits/cookies. You want them mostly crushed with some pea-size crumbs left for texture. 4. Pour the cookie crumbs, rolled oats and oat bran into the chocolate mixture and give it all a big good stir. 5. Prepare an 8x8 pan by laying a large sheet of cling wrap or foil on the base and up the sides of the pan but make sure it has a good overhang (for easy removal). 6. Pour the mixture into the pan and use a spatula to smooth the thick mixture. It WILL look greasy. Cover the pan with cling wrap or foil and refrigerate till firm, about 1 hour. 7. To serve, remove the hardened goodness from the pan using the overhanging foil and cut into 1x1 inch squares. They get soft so make sure to keep in the fridge until serving time.

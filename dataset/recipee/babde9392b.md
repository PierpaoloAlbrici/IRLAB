### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 3/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cumin seed

 - 1 pinch of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1/2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350F. Place the flour, salt, baking powder, cumin or coriander, and cayenne in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade; pulse to combine. Add the butter or shortening; pulse until coarse crumbs form. With the machine running, add the milk slowly through the feed tube, just until the dough comes together. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface, and knead once or twice until smooth. Roll out to 1/4 inch thick. Sprinkle with salt, and roll lightly to make it adhere. Using a 1 1/2-inch round or octagonal cookie cutter, cut out the dough, and transfer to an ungreased baking sheet. Gather together the scraps; reroll to cut out additional biscuits, if desired. Bake until golden, about 20 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool slightly before serving.

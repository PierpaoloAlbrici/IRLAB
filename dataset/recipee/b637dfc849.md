### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of butter, salted

### Instructions

Prepare cookie sheet or jelly roll pan by covering it with waxed paper. Sprinkle 1/4 cup hazelnuts on pan, spread out evenly. Melt butter over low heat. Add sugar, salt, and corn syrup and stir till sugar is dissolved. Bring heat to medium-high, bring mixture to a boil, stirring occasionally, and boil until it caramelizes and reaches 300 on a candy thermometer. Pour candy over hazelnuts on sheet pan, spreading with a metal or wooden spatula as thin as possible (approximately 1/4 inch). Immediately top with chocolate, spreading with a spatula as it melts to cover the entire surface of the toffee. Top with remaining nuts, pressing into chocolate. Chill until cool and chocolate has hardened. Peel toffee from wax paper, break into bite-size pieces to serve.

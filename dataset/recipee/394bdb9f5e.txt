Basic Flour Tortilla Recipe


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/4 cup of oil, canola


 - 1 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

In a large mixing bowl, combine all of the ingredients and 1/2 of the water. Mix together with your hands and continue adding water into the dough till it forms a solid ball, but is not too sticky. If necessary, add in additional flour or possibly water as needed. Knead the dough on a floured board for 5 min. Cut the dough in half and then in half again, continuing the process till you have 8 equal portions. Roll each piece into a ball, place them on a lightly floured surface, and cover with a damp towel. Heat a griddle or possibly cast iron pan to medium heat. Roll out the dough, one piece at a time to about 1/4 inch thickness. Place one round of dough on the griddle and cook on each side for about 30 seconds. Take care which the griddle is not too warm or possibly the tortillas will scorch. Continue the process with the remaining 7 portions of dough. The cooked tortillas will keep for two weeks in the refrigerator or possibly up to six months in the freezer. Makes 8 large tortillas.

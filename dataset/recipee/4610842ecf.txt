Camping Seasoning Mix Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1/3 cup of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, paprika


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 2 teaspoon of onions, raw


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Mix well and store in a double zip-lock bag or possibly a good screw-top container. I usually make up 2 or possibly 3 combinations when back-packing so which I have seasoning for meats, fish or possibly the ubiquitous curry. By "Deborah K=FChnen"

Perfect Pie Crust


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 cup of oil, corn, peanut, and olive


 - 14 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


Instructions: 

Sift measured flour and salt into a bowl. Pour oil into glass measuring cup and add cold milk to make 3/4 cup liquid. Pour liquid into bowl and stir with a fork to mix well. Stir until it forms into a soft ball. Save half the dough to use later. Roll remaining half of dough into circle between two sheets of wax paper. Peel off top layer of wax paper. Place pie pan upside down on top of rolled out dough. Slide hand under bottom wax paper with top hand lightly on pan. Flip pan, crust and wax paper over gently. Crust and wax paper will gently settle into pan. Then peel second wax paper off crust. Fit crust into pie pan, make standing rim, and prick with fork. I use pie weights to keep shell flat. Bake in oven 450F for 8- 10 minutes.

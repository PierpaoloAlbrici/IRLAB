### Instructions

Add buttermilk and milk to a clean glass quart jar. Cover. Let sit in a warm place for about 14 hours; the time will vary depending on how warm your house is and it can take as long as 24 hours. Check every few hours after the first 12 - 14. When buttermilk reaches a nice thick consistency, place in fridge to cool down and store. From this culture you can continue to make your own continuous supply of buttermilk.

Ingredients


 - 10 ounce of blueberries, raw


 - 1 pound of peaches, yellow, raw


 - 14 cup of apple juice, canned or bottled, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid


 - 12 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 12 cup of oats


 - 1 cup of dates, deglet noor


 - 2 tablespoon of apple juice, canned or bottled, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350. Place blueberries in the bottom of a square 8 inch baking pan. If you are using frozen, make sure they are completely thawed and drained of excess water. Place peach slices on top of blueberries. If they are frozen make sure they are also thawed and drained of excess water. Drizzle 1/4 cup apple juice over fruit. Remove pits from dates and place in the bowl of a food processor along with oats, almonds and cinnamon. After running for a minute and dates are blended with oats and almonds, add apple juice, and mix well. Place mixture evenly over peaches and blueberries, and bake uncovered for about 45 minutes. Serve warm or cool. Healthy Cooking Tips:. Make sure the topping is well ground, and mixed while still ending with a coarse texture. It will have a tendency to be in clumps after processing it. When you place it over the fruit mixture crumple it with your hands into an even layer. Otherwise it will be in big clumps and will not look or taste as good.

Spanish Potato Salad ( No Mayonnaise)


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 pound of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 13 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 3 tablespoon of vinegar, red wine


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 7 ounce of cherries, sweet, raw


 - 12 cup of onions, raw


 - 12 cup of olives, ripe, canned (small-extra large)


Instructions: 

Scrub potatoes, and in a large pot of boiling salted water, cook potatoes 20 to 25 minutes until just tender. If your potatoes vary in size, remove them individually as they reach this stage and allow the larger ones to continue cooking until they also are tender. Drain potatoes and set aside until cool enough to handle. In a large bowl, whisk together oil, vinegar, salt and pepper until well combined. Add to this the tomatoes, onion, and olives and mix well. Remove skin from potatoes, and cut into 1/2 inch pieces. Add potatoes to the bowl of other ingredients, and mix well. Serve well chilled.

Homemade Ricotta Cheese (Crock Pot)


Ingredients


 - 12 gallon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 4 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

Combine the milk and acid (white vinegar, lemon juice, Champagne vinegar, or white wine vinegar) in the crockpot and heat on low until temperature reaches 180 degrees F. (At 7,000 feet or above, bring it to 172 degrees F.) If heating on a stove top use a heavy pan and very low heat. It takes about 30 minutes. (Do not try to hurry this process; the milk might scorch on the bottom of the pan and you'll have brown specs in the cheese. ). Once the temperature has reached 180 degrees, remove from heat, cover and seet aside in a warm place (80 - 100 degrees F) for about six hours. The cheese is ready to strain when a solid curd has formed. Strain through several layers of dampened cheese cloth or a fine metal strainer; discaring the whey (the watery residue).

### Ingredients

 - 8 ounce of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 1/2 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt

 - 1/3 cup of apricots, dried, sulfured, uncooked

 - 1/3 cup of raisins, seeded

### Instructions

Melt chocolate in a large metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, line bottom and sides of a 13- by 9-inch baking pan with foil, leaving a 1-inch overhang, then lightly oil foil. When chocolate is smooth, remove bowl from pan and cool chocolate to warm, then add cereal and fruit, stirring gently until combined well. Spread evenly in baking pan and chill until firm, at least 2 and up to 24 hours. Lift candy in foil from pan and transfer to a cutting board. Peel off foil and break candy into 2-inch pieces.

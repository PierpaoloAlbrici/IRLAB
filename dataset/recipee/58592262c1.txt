Honey Butter Recipe


Ingredients


 - 8 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 5 teaspoon of honey


 - 1/8 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Place the butter in a medium bowl and mash it with a rubber spatula until its very spreadable. Add the remaining ingredients and mix until thoroughly combined. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve immediately. Alternatively, to serve this compound butter as a sliceable stick, transfer the butter mixture to a sheet of plastic wrap. Shape it into a log by rolling it up in the plastic wrap, then twist the ends to seal. Place in the refrigerator to harden, at least 30 minutes.

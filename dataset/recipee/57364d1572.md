### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of oats

 - 1 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 13 cup of sugars, brown

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 14 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 14 cup of honey

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 300*. Spray or oil large baking sheet. Mix oats, almonds, brown sugar, salt, and cinnamon in large bowl. In small saucepan, combine oil, honey, and sugar; bring to boil over medium heat. Remove from heat and add vanilla. Pour hot liquid over oats mixture, stirring/tossing with rubber scraper to mix well. Spread granola on prepared baking pan. Bake until golden brown, approximately 30 minutes, checking frequently after 20 minutes. Optional: Remove from oven and stir oat mixture every 5-10 minutes of baking. (I don't stir at all -- makes for chunkier granola! ). Remove from oven to cooling rack and cool completely. I do not stir the granola after taking it out of the oven. The granola will clump (stick together) as it cools. Store up to two weeks in airtight container at room temperature. Makes 8 cups.

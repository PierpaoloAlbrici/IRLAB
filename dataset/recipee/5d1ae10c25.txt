Turkey Curry Burgers


Ingredients


 - 14 ounce of ground turkey, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of onions, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, curry powder


 - 2 tablespoon of mango nectar, canned


Instructions: 

Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl with your hands until well combined. Put into the fridge for about 10 minutes to allow the mixture to firm up a bit. Take out of the fridge and form into four equal sized patties. Fry the burgers as you would any other burger for about 5 minutes each side or until cooked through. (I do mine on my Foreman Grill brushed very lightly with some canola oil to save me having to fry them and add extra fats). Put on buns and top with your choice of toppings (I go simply with crisp lettuce and a bit of extra mango chutney) and serve.

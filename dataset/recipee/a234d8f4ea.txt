Easy Homemade Pie Crust


Ingredients


 - 2 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 7 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 tablespoon of vinegar, cider


Instructions: 

Combine flour, salt, and butter in a food processor. Pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 10 1-second pulses. Stir water and vinegar in a small bowl. Pour half the ice water and vinegar mixture into the flour and butter mixture. Pulse to combine, about 3 (1-second) pulses. Pour in remaining ice water and vinegar mixture. Pulse until mixture just starts to come together, about 8 (1-second) pulses. Turn dough out onto a wooden surface, pat into round shape and divide in half. Form each half into a disc about 5 inches wide. Wrap each disc in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes until ready to use.

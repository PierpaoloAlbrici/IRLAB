Cajun Seasoning

Instructions: 

I run these through the Magic Bullet, but its really not necessary. You can simply mix all the spices together. This makes a small amount, which can be stored in the small 100-calorie-sized Ziploc bags. I store all my HCG seasoning in Ziploc bags, in a Tupperware container in the freezer. Maybe thats a little overkill.

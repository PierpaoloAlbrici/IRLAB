 - 15 g of butter, without salt

Instructions: 

Line a 4.5 x 4.5 baking dish with parchment paper (the height of your chocolate will depend on the size of your baking dish). In a pan (make sure the pan is completely dry), add whipping cream, chocolate chips and butter. Cook over low heat (the chocolate may separate from oil under high heat) and keep stirring until the chocolate chips dissolved and well combined. Pour the mixture into the baking dish. Refrigerate until firm, about 4-5 hours. Remove the chocolate from baking dish. Warm a knife (you can warm it with hot water, but make sure to dry the knife completely before cutting) and cut the chocolate into cubes. Sprinkle cocoa powder on top of the chocolate.

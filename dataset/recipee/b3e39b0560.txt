No Yeast Homemade Pizza


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 13 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven 425 degrees F. Combine all ingredients and knead ten times. Let stand for ten minutes. Put dough on a cookie sheet and roll or press out. Top with toppings (my favorite--cheese and large slices of fresh Roma tomato). Bake 20-25 minutes or until edges are golden.

Apple Crumble


Ingredients


 - 4 pound of apples, raw, with skin


 - 1/2 pound of sugars, granulated


 - 2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/2 pound of butter, without salt


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, brown


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 400F. Peel and core apples Slice apples as thin as possible. I use a food processor to cut them fast, thin and even. Mix sugar and cinnamon In a large casserole spread the first layer of apples about 1/2" to 3/4" thick Cover with a layer of sugar and cinnamon. Repeat step 5 and 6 until all apples are used. Bake on middle rack for about 10 min. While the apples are baking mix the flour and the brown sugar. Cut up the butter in small pieces and add to flour-sugar mix. Knete with hands until butter is mixed in and crumbles are forming. Take apples out of oven, cover with crumbles and bake for another 15 -20 minutes. The crumble is done when the apples are not hard anymore. If the topping is getting too dark cover with aluminum foil or put a cookie sheet on the top rack.

Instructions: 

Grease and lightly flour a large baking sheet; set aside. For the cornmeal crust, in a medium bowl stir together 3/4 cup flour, cornmeal, 2 tablespoons Splenda, baking powder, and salt. Cut in butter or margarine until the size of small peas. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of cold fat-free milk over mixture; gently toss with a fork. Add 3 to 4 tablespoons more fat-free milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough is moistened (dough will be crumbly). Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 7 to 8 times or just until dough clings together and form into a ball. On the baking sheet, flatten dough. Roll into a 12-inch circle and set aside. For Filling:. In a bowl stir together 1/3 cup Splenda, the 3 tablespoons flour, and the nutmeg or cinnamon. Stir in the apricots or peaches and lemon juice. Mound the filling in center of crust, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold border up over filling. Brush top and sides of crust with the 2 teaspoons milk. Bake in a 350 F degree oven about 40 minutes or until crust is golden and filling is bubbly. To prevent overbrowning, cover the edge of the crust with foil the last 10 to 15 minutes of baking if needed. Cool tart for 30 minutes on the baking sheet on a wire rack.

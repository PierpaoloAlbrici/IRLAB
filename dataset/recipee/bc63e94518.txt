Macadamia and Ginger Shortbread


Ingredients


 - 100 g of nuts, macadamia nuts, raw


 - 250 g of butter, without salt


 - 12 cup of sugars, powdered


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 cup of rice flour, white, unenriched


 - 125 g of spices, ginger, ground


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, powdered


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 130C (fan forced). Spread nuts on a baking tray and cook for 7 to 8 minutes, or until lightly golden and then cool and chop. Use electric beaters to beat butter and sugar until light and creamy and then add sifted flours, using a butter knife to mix together, then add the ginger and macadamia nuts and mix. Gather dough together and turn out onto a sheet of non-stick baking paper and press dough out to a 25cm round. With dough still on the paper, lift it onto a baking tray and use your fingers to pinch the edges to give a fluted effect. Score dough into wedges and prick with a fork and sprinkle the extra sugar on. Cook for 35 minutes, or until firm and pale golden. Cool on tray, dust with icing sugar and then cut into wedges.

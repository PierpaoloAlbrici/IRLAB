### Ingredients

 - 300 g of water, bottled, generic

 - 20 g of candies, dark chocolate coated coffee beans

### Instructions

Line a Clever Dripper with a size 4 white paper filter. In a burr grinder set to a medium-coarse grind size, grind the coffee beans. Heat the water until it registers 206 on an instant-read thermometer; alternatively, bring the water to a boil, then let stand for 1 minute. Pour some of the hot water into the dripper, thoroughly soaking the filter. Set the dripper on top of a coffee cup and allow the rinsing water to fully drain into the cup. Discard the rinsing water. Pour the ground coffee into the filter. Place the dripper on a kitchen scale and set the scale to zero. Pour 300 grams of hot water into the dripper, thoroughly saturating the coffee grounds. Let stand, covered, for 1 minute. Uncover and quickly stir the steeping coffee to break up the cap of grounds floating on top. Let stand, covered, for 2 1/2 minutes longer, then quickly stir the coffee once more. Set the dripper on the coffee cup and allow the coffee to fully drain into the cup.

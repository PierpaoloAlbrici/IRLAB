Melon Sorbet


Ingredients


 - 2 1/2 pound of melons, honeydew, raw


 - 3/4 cup of syrups, sugar free


Instructions: 

In a blender, puree the cantaloupe until smooth. You should have 2 1/2 cups of melon puree; reserve any extra for another use. Stir in the Sugar Syrup. Pour the sorbet base into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pack the melon sorbet into an airtight plastic container. Press a sheet of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the sorbet, cover and freeze until firm, about 4 hours. Scoop into bowls and serve.

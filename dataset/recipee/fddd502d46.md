### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 3 cup of nuts, pecans

 - 2 tablespoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, chili powder

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F, then use a vegetable oil spray to lightly coat a large but shallow baking sheet. In a bowl combine the 1/2 cup of sugar & the warm water, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Add pecans & let soak 10 minutes before draining & discarding the water. In a large bowl, stir together the 1/4 cup of sugar, cocoa, chili powder & cayenne pepper. Add pecans to this spicy cocoa mixture & toss until all the cocoa mixture coats the pecans, then spread the nuts evenly on the prepared pan. Bake 10 to 15 minutes or until pecans start to glisten & appear dry, stirring several times while baking. Remove from the oven & let the baking sheet cool completely on a wire rack. Store nuts in a tightly covered container, placed in a cool, dry spot. Serve as a snack, with beverages, or sprinkle in salads.

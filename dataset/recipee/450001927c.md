[450001927c](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1628)

### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

 - 1/2 cup of butter, without salt

 - 2 cup of cheese, cheddar

 - 1/2 teaspoon of sauce, worcestershire

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 1/2 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Spread the sesame seeds on a baking sheet. Bake them for five minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are toasted golden but not brown. Transfer to a bowl and cool. Using a wooden spoon, beat the butter and cheese together in a bowl until they are well blended. Blend in the Worcestershire sauce. In another bowl, stir together the flour, cayenne, mustard, salt and sesame seeds. Gradually stir into the butter mixture to make a stiff dough, then knead to blend all the ingredients evenly. Pinch off small pieces of dough and roll them into marble-sized balls. Place them about an inch apart on ungreased baking sheets. Flatten with the tines of a fork in a crisscross pattern. Bake them for 12 minutes, or until they are crisp but not brown. Cool on racks. Store in airtight container.

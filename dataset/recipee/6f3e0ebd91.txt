Peanut-Carob Isabooscotti


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 2 pinch of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 cup of carob flour


Instructions: 

Pre-heat the oven to 400F In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and cinnamon. Place the peanut butter in a medium size bowl and microwave at high power to soften, 5-10 seconds. Whisk in the milk, then stir the mixture into the dry ingredients. Shape the dough into a long, flattened log and place on a greased baking sheet. Bake for 20 minutes; remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes. Slice the log crosswise on an angle into 1-inch-thick pieces. Set the slices on their sides (they should look like biscotti) and bake until crisp, 10-12 minutes more. Transfer to a rack to cool. Melt the carob in a microwave or on the stovetop over low heat. Thin the melted carob with 1 tablespoon water, if needed. Using a spoon, drizzle the melted carob over the biscuits. Let cool completely. Store in an airtight container.

Bread Machine Whole Wheat Rolls


Ingredients


 - 1 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 2 tablespoon of honey


 - 2 tablespoon of molasses


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


Instructions: 

Place the ingredients into the bread baking pan as recommended by your bread machine's manual. Use the DOUGH cycle setting. To hand shape the roll, once the dough cycle is complete remove the dough to a lightly floured cutting board. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces and shape into balls. Place the rolls into greased muffin tins, brush lightly with melted butter or butter substitute. Cover with a piece of wax paper and a clean cloth and let rise in a warm place for about 15-20 minutes. Bake the rolls at 375F for 15-20 minutes. Refrigerate leftovers. *NOTE: Here's a trick to measure the honey and molasses easily. By measuring the oil first, the oil coats the measuring utensil. Then when you measure out the honey and molasses the two ingredients slide off easily into the bread machine pan.

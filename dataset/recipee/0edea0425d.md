### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray an 8 by 8 baking pan with cooking spray and set aside. 2. In a large bowl, whisk oats, spices, and salt together. Set aside. 3. In a medium bowl, whisk brown sugar, pumpkin, applesauce, honey, and vanilla extract until smooth. Pour over oats and stir well, until all of the oats are moist. Stir in chocolate chips. 4. Evenly press oat mixture into prepared pan. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. The pumpkin keeps the bars moist, so make sure they are golden and set; you dont want them to be under baked. Remove from the oven and let cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. 5. Using a sharp knife, cut into bars. Remove from pan and let cool completely. Makes 10-12 granola bars.

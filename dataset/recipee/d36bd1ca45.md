### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of butter, salted

 - 1 3/4 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 cup of nuts, pecans

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. In a bowl, cream together butter and 3/4 cup of the powdered sugar. Add the flour, vanilla and ground pecans. Stir to combine. Shape dough into balls, using a slightly rounded teaspoon for each. Place 2 inches apart on a parchment-lined cookie sheet. Bake until the edges turn gold, about 20 minutes. Transfer cookies to a rack to cool. Cookies can be frozen in an airtight container, with wax paper between each layer for up to 6 months. Defrost 30 minutes. Just before serving, place the remaining cup of powdered sugar in a plastic bag. Add several cookies and shake gently to dust with sugar. Repeat with remaining cookies.

All Natural Granola Bars


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of honey


 - 23 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 2 2/3 cup of oats

Instructions: 

Warm honey slightly in microwave and combine with peanut butter. Add oats, ground pecans, flour, and cinnamon. Stir in nuts, chips, dried fruit, etc. (My favorite combo is 1/2C of dried fruit, 1/2C of mini choc. chips, 1/2C chopped almonds, 1/4C sunflower seeds, and 1/4C ground flax seeds). PRESS DOWN FIRMLY and evenly in sprayed 9x13 pan. Bake @ 350 for about 15 minutes - edges will begin to brown. Remove from oven and cut IMMEDIATELY into 20 bars. Allow to cool completely. I wrap bars individually for easy grabbing in the mornings!

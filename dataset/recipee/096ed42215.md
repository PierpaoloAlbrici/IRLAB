[096ed42215](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/368729-easy-creamy-pesto-pasta)

### Ingredients

 - 11 ounce of sauce, pesto, classico, basil pesto, ready-to-serve

 - 1 pound of noodles, egg, dry, unenriched

 - 1/2 pint of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

### Instructions

Cook penne noodles until they're done to your liking. When noodles are almost done, mix heavy whipping cream and pesto in a bowl until well blended together. When noodles are done, drain them and then put them back into the pot. Then pour creamy pesto sauce on noodles and stir together Add as much shredded Parmesan cheese as you'd like into your own bowl of pasta and mix around. Enjoy! And as a side note, I have tried to use another brand of pesto for this recipe and it wasn't very good so if you want to be on the safe side, Buitoni brand is your best bet.

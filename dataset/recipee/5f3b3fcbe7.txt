Parmesan Crisps


Ingredients


 - 4 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper. Grate 2 ounces of the Parmesan using the side of the box grater that finely grinds the cheese and then grate 2 ounces of the Parmesan using the side of the box grater that makes long shreds of cheese, and then mix them together. Drop rounded tablespoons of the grated Parmesan on the parchment paper to make neat mounds. Bake in the oven for 6 minutes until golden. Cool slightly and loosen with a metal spatula. Serve at room temperature.

Cream Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 3 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 1/4 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 2 tablespoon of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Form well in center and add cream. Stir just until dough forms a soft ball. Place dough on a heavily floured surface (about 3/-1 cup flour). Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough. Press dough on top and sides just enough to adhere dough and flatten to about 1-inch thick. With floured rolling pin, roll dough just 1 or 2 rolls to flatten the top, leaving dough about 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick (your preference). Roll as little as possible, as working dough makes it less tender. With 2 or 2 1/2-inch round biscuit cutter dipped in flour, cut biscuits and place biscuits, almost touching, on an ungreased baking sheet. After cutting biscuits, gather scraps and re-roll dough, cutting more biscuits in the same manner. Brush the tops of biscuits with buttermilk and bake for 15 minutes or until they are pale golden brown. Serve. MAKE AHEAD: Freeze biscuits, not touching, on baking sheet. Freeze until solid. Remove biscuits and place in freezer, resealable plastic bag, To bake, place frozen biscuits on ungreased baking sheet, bake at 400 degrees until golden brown, 20-30 minutes (this is a guess). SUBSTITUTIONS: If you want to use self-rising flour, omit the salt and use only 2 teaspoons. baking powder. NOTE: These can be cut into smaller biscuits and baked a little less. Use for baby ham biscuit or appetizers or a brunch.

Pepparkakor(Swedish Pepper Hearts)


Ingredients


 - 5 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, cloves, ground


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cardamom


 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 34 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Mix flour, spices and baking soda; set aside. In a large bowl, beat butter and sugar with electric mixer until blended. Beat in water gradually; beat in flour until well blended; dough will be soft. Divide into four sections. Shape each fourth into a one-inch-thick circle on a piece of plastic wrap. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease cookies sheets. On a lightly floured surface, with a floured rolling pin, roll a quarter of the dough at a time to one-eighth-inch thick. Cut out three-inch-wide hearts. Place one inch apart on cookie sheets and bake 5 to 7 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool on cookie sheets for 2 minutes. Remove to wire rack to cool. May be frosted with butter icing, using maraschino cherry juice instead of milk to make the frosting.

### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 cup of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 cup of squash, summer, zucchini, includes skin, raw

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 F and grease a 9 x 13 inch baking pan. In a large bowl, combine the oil, sugar and vanilla until well blended. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, baking soda and salt. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients, stirring just to combine. Fold in the zucchini and mix well. The batter will be very dry, but do not worry. The grated zucchini will release just enough moisture during the baking process to produce a moist and chewy brownie texture. Spread into the prepared pan, gently patting the mixture down. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until brownies spring back when gently pressed. Cool for 30 minutes to 1 hour or until brownies are easy to slice.

Broccoli Slaw


Ingredients


 - 12 ounce of fast foods, coleslaw


 - 12 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular


 - 14 cup of vinegar, cider


 - 4 teaspoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


 - 1 teaspoon of celery, raw


Instructions: 

In a bowl combine the mayo, apple cider vinegar, sugar , black pepper, and celery seed. The mixture should resemble a creamy dressing consistency. You made need to add extra vinegar, sugar, pepper, and celery seed to your taste. I tend to add a little more vinegar to thin it out and use splenda instead of sugar. Toss broccoli slaw with dressing and even coat. Refridgerate before serving.

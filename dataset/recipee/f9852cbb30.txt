Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 350 deg F. Slice mangoes into thirds vertically to remove the pit. Scoop out the flesh and place in an 8x8 inch baking pan. Top mango with quartered strawberries and drizzle with 1/4 cup pineapple juice (can also use canned pineapple). To make the topping, place remaining dry ingredients in a food processor and process until mixed but still slightly chunky. Add 2 tablespoons pineapple juice and briefly process to incorporate. Spread the topping mixture over the fruit. Bake for 45 minutes.

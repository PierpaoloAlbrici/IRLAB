[fb20ca7ffd](http://www.food.com/recipe/crock-pot-awesome-apple-butter-70153)

### Ingredients

 - 4 pound of apples, raw, with skin

 - 2 cup of apple juice, canned or bottled, unsweetened, without added ascorbic acid

 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 1/4 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, nutmeg, ground

### Instructions

Wash, peel, core, and coarsely chop the apples. Place apples in a large pot with the apple juice. Bring the mixture to a boil on the stovetop; reduce heat and simmer until the apples are soft, about 30 minutes. Strain the soft apples and juice through a food mill or press through a fine mesh sieve right into a large crock pot. For a finer consistency, strain the pulp twice. Stir in the sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg until well blended. Cover and cook on low heat for 12-14 hours until thickened. The butter is done when it mounds up on a spoon and has a glossy sheen. The butter is also done when a spoonful placed on a chilled plate does not release any liquid. Ladle butter into clean, hot half-pint or pint jars. Wipe rims with a damp cloth. Place dome lids on the jars and screw on the bands. Process jars in a 200F water bath 10 minutes for half-pints, 15 minutes for pints.

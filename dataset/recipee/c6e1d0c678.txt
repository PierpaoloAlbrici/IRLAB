Measure carefully, placing all ingredients except seeds in bread machine pan in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Add nuts at the Raisin/Nut signal or 5 to 10 minutes before last kneading cycle ends. Select Basic/White cycle. Use Medium or Light crust color. Do not use delay cycle. Remove baked bread from pan, and cool on wire rack. I made mine on the Dough cycle. At the end place dough on floured counter; cut in half, shape into 2 loaves and place in 2- 8" loaf pans. Slash the loaves and brush with liquid eggs if available.Let rise 45 minutes in warm place. Bake at 350* for 30 minutes or until cooked.

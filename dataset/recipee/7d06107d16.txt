Saute onions in 2 tbsps oil in a medium skillet on medium heat until they begin to soften, 2-3 minutes. Add mushrooms and continue to saute until mushrooms are softened, 2-4 minutes. Set aside and keep warm. In a medium sauce pan (should hold at least 6 cups), heat 1/2 cup of oil over medium heat. Add flour and bubble for 1-2 minutes stirring constantly.

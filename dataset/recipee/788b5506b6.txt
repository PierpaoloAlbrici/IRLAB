Wv Summertime Canned Pickles


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of salt, table


 - 3 cup of vinegar, distilled


 - 1 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 5 pound of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 2 teaspoon of celery, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


Instructions: 

Cut 1 gallon of cucumbers paper thin (I use the Vidalia Slice Wizard). In a very large container (2 gallon crock) fill with 1 gallon of water. Adding enough canning salt to float an egg in the water, then add your slices. Cover and let them stand one week, stirring every day. On the seventh day, drain. Cover slices in hot water with alum (1.9 oz entire container). Simmer 10 minutes, drain water. Cover with water again, adding 2 tablespoons of ginger, simmer 10 minutes then drain. Add: 3 cups of vinegar, 1 1.5 cups of water, 5 pounds of sugar minus 1 cup of sugar, 2 teaspoons of celery seed and 2 tablespoons of small pieces of cinnamon stick. Cover and simmer until pickles look glossy. Put in jars, (boiling lids only), place lds on jars and as you know -- listen for the POP!

### Ingredients

 - 2 1/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, caraway seed

### Instructions

In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the water. In a medium bowl, blend the flour and salt. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the vegetable oil and caraway seeds. Add the yeast mixture and stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Remove the dough to a lightly floured board and kneed a few times until smooth. Transfer to an oiled bowl, turn the dough to grease it: let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350F (180C) F, punch the dough down and cut into 20 pieces or 40 pieces if you prefer smaller crackers. Roll each piece into a ball and press into a disk. Roll one disk of dough out as thin as possible, by hand or with a pasta machine into a round or oblong. Place 2 to 4 crackers (however many will fit) on a lightly oiled baking sheet and prick with a fork at 2 inch intervals. Bake until lightly browned around the edges, about 15 minutes. Remove to a rack and allow to cool and finish drying out. Store in an airtight tin.

Instructions: 

I came across this very interesting recipe a while back in the Weekend magazine. A lady wrote that she had a beautiful fairly good wheatish complexion. However, after she delivered her first child, she used to have coconut oil massages and as a result she acquired a tan. She wanted to get rid of this tan. For this, Rima Soni has suggested her the following treatment: Massage the tanned skin with a mixture of yogurt or milk and honey. Leave it on for an hour. Rinse. This cleans and moisturises the skin as well as lightens it. This must be done daily and soon the difference will be visible!

### Ingredients

 - 3 tablespoon of butter, salted

 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 7 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 3 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1/2 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, poppy seed

### Instructions

In a small saucepan, melt the butter. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice, sugar, and flour. Mix in the almonds and poppy seeds and let the mixture rest for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350F (175C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Have ready 4 overturned teacups or custard cups. Put 4 level tablespoons of batter, evenly spaced, on the baking sheet and use the back of the spoon to spread them into circles 2 inches (5 cm) across. Bake the cookies for 10 minutes, until theyre deep golden brown. Let rest for 30 to 45 seconds, then lift each cookie off the baking sheet with a flexible metal spatula and flip it over onto an upended teacup. (If the cookies get too firm to shape, return them to the oven for 30 seconds to soften them.) Let the baking sheet cool, then repeat with the remaining batter. Store these cookie cups in an airtight container. They are best served the day theyre made. The batter can be made and refrigerated up to 1 week in advance. Let it come to room temperature before baking.

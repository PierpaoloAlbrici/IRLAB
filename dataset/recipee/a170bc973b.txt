My Note: If do not have lemon juice use 1 teaspoon vinegar OR 1 teaspoon white wine OR 1 teaspoon lime juice or 1 tablespoon other citrus juice Pineapple will work. Tip's: I melted the butter in a pan, added the lemon then sprinkled with the spices, and baked it in the butter . prep time was less than 5 minutes . I you do not have lemon juice maybe a 1 teaspoon vinegar OR 1 teaspoon white wine OR 1 teaspoon lime juice or 1 tablespoon other citrus juice, Pineapple will work too. I went ahead and made it to recipe anyway, and it turned out fine. I did it With Pineapple juice. Prep time was less than 5 minutes .

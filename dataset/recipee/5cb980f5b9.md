### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt

 - 1 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 tablespoon of syrups, corn, light

 - 3 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 16 ounce of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 cup of nuts, almonds

### Instructions

Melt margarine in a heavy 2-quart pan. Add sugar, syrup and water. Cook, stirring often, to hard crack stage, 300 degrees (watch carefully after 280 degrees). Quickly stir in coarsely chopped almonds. Spread mixture in well greased 13x9x2 pan. Allow toffee to harden for about 5 minutes. Place chocolate evenly over toffee. After chocolate melts, spread evenly over toffee. Sprinkle finely chopped almonds on top of chocolate. DO NOT refrigerate. Cool at room temperature. Chop into pieces with knife and enjoy! Note - It is important that you do not refrigerate before breaking into small pieces because the toffee will separate from the chocolate (i'm speaking from experience! ).

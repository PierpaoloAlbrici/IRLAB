Cinnamon Vanilla Granola Peach Crisp


Ingredients


 - 6 cup of peaches, yellow, raw


 - 14 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 12 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 cup of cereals ready-to-eat, granola, homemade


 - 14 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 12 cup of sugars, brown


 - 14 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 14 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 12 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 12 cup of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Mix 1/4 cup flour, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 vanilla powder together. Brown sugar can be added to sweeten fruit if needed. Place drained fruit in a casserole or square pan. Stir in flour mixture, set aside. In medium bowl combine granola, instant oatmeal, brown sugar, flour, almonds, cinnamon and vanilla powder until mixed. The small crumbs at the bottom of the granola bag work well for this. Cut in butter until crumbly. Top peaches with crumb mixture. Bake at 375 degrees for 35 minutes until bubbly and top golden brown.

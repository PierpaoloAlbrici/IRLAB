Ingredients


 - 2 cup of sugars, brown


 - 1/3 cup of syrups, corn, light


 - 1/4 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 1/4 cup of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Mix all the ingredients together, and cook over medium heat in a heavy kettle or pot until a few drops dropped into a little cold water form a very soft ball (it just barely forms). Cool. Pour into a container that has a tight fitting lid. Refrigerate. *This is good cold or warm. * **This recipe makes about 1 1/2 cups. ** ***This recipe brought to you courtesy of Norske Nook Roadside Cafe right here in the state of Wisconsin. ***

### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

 - 2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Spread the almonds in a single layer in a shallow ungreased baking pan and place in cold oven. Bake at 350F, stirring occasionally, until the internal color of the nut is tan to light brown, 12 to 15 minutes. (The nuts will continue to roast a little more after they are removed from the oven.) Set the roasted almonds aside. Thoroughly mix the sugar and salt, and set aside. Stir together the honey, water, and oil in a medium-size saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Stir in the roasted almonds and continue to cook and stir until all of the liquid has been absorbed by the nuts, about 5 minutes. Immediately transfer the almonds to a medium-sized bowl into which some sugar mixture has been sprinkled. Sprinkle the remaining sugar mixture over the almonds and toss until they are evenly coated. Spread the almonds out onto a silicon pad or parchment paper. When cool, store at room temperature in a tightly covered container or plastic bag. Will keep up to 2 weeks.

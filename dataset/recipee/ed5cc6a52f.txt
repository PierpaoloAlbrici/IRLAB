Peach Almond Crisp (Simple and Lite)


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of peaches, yellow, raw


 - 1 cup of oats


 - 14 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 2 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 3 tablespoon of honey


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350F degrees. Peaches:. If frozen, thaw just half way, so that the peaches are still partially frozen. I like to use my frozen peaches but fresh peaches may be used. Empty peaches and their juice into a 6 cup casserole, set aside. In a small bowl, mix together rolled oats, almonds, splenda brown sugar mix and mix well; drizzle honey over mixture and stir through. Spread rolled oats mixture evenly over peaches in casserole. Bake in 350f degree oven for 45 minutes, until topping is well browned and crisp. Depending on your peaches, this crisp is not sweet, just the way we like it; if you prefer your crisp sweeter add a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar mix to your peaches.

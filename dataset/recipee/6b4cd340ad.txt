How to Make Domino Cookies


Ingredients


 - 3/4 pound of butter, without salt


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 3 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 ounce of candies, semisweet chocolate


Instructions: 

1. Preheat your oven to 350 F. 2. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix together the butter and 1 cup of sugar until they are just combined. Add the vanilla and combine. 3. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour and salt, then add them to the butter-and-sugar mixture. Mix on low speed until the dough starts to come together. Mold onto a surface dusted with flour and shape into a flat disk. Wrap the disk in plastic and chill for 2 hours. 4. Roll the dough 1/2-inch thick and cut with sharp knife into rectangles that are about 2 long and 1 wide. Use a candy stick to make Domino dots and the back of the knife to create the indentation in the middle. See photo or related blog link for step-by-step. Place the cookies on an un-greased baking sheet. 5. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the edges begin to brown barely. Remove from oven and move cookies to a cooling rack. Allow to cool to room temperature. 6. Once cool, melt your chocolate in a glass bowl in the microwave at 30 second intervals, stirring in between. Using a candy stick put little drops of chocolate on the domino holes. Let them dry and you are ready to play (or eat)!

Pella


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of beef, grass-fed, ground, raw


 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Cut the fat into 1" chunks. Place in a very heavy pan over medium heat. After around 30 minutes, the meat bits should begin to brown. Reduce heat to low, scrape the pan, turning fat. Add water. (be careful with this. do it slowly to make sure everything doesn't blow -- ). Simmer until fat is completely rendered, anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 hours. Very high quality, pure fat will render more quickly. Strain into jar or small bowl and let cool. Keep in refrigerator.

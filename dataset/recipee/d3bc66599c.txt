ANZAC Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 3/4 cup of oats


 - 1 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 3/4 cup of butter, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of syrup, maple, canadian


 - 3/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 6 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. In a large bowl, combine flour, oats, sugar, coconut, and salt. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt butter with syrup. Dissolve baking soda in boiling water, and add to butter mixture. Stir to combine. (Be careful; it will bubble up considerably.) Add butter mixture to dry ingredients and stir to combine. Using a 1 1/2-inch ice-cream scoop or rounded tablespoon, drop balls of dough onto prepared baking sheets, about 2 inches apart. Flatten with the heel of your hand. Bake until golden brown and firm but not hard, about 15 minutes, rotating sheets halfway through. Transfer to wire racks to cool. Cookies can be stored between layers of parchment in an airtight container at room temperature up to 1 week.

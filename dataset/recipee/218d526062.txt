Ingredients


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, ginger, ground


 - 16 ounce of cranberries, dried, sweetened

Instructions: 

In a saucepan, over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the ginger and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Stir in the cranberries, sugar, orange juice, and preserves. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the cranberries burst and the sauce thickens, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and serve warm.

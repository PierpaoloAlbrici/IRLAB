Crunchy Chocolate Icebox Cookies


Ingredients


 - 50 g of butter, without salt


 - 25 g of sugars, powdered


 - 1 teaspoon of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 20 g of nuts, almonds


 - 70 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 5 g of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened


Instructions: 

Cream the butter and sugar into a bowl until pale and thick. Add the heavy cream and mix. Since it's just a small amount, it won't separate. Add the sifted flour, cocoa, and almond flour to Step 2 and mix in a cutting motion. When the batter begins to stick to the bowl, gather it all into one lump. Separate the batter into halves and form 2 cylinders with a diameter of 2 cm. Wrap them up and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Adjust the shape and leave in the freezer for 30 minutes. Cut pieces to a width of 7 mm and bake in a oven at 160C for 13 minutes. Then they're done. Note: The chocolate chip cookies on the right in the picture were made by breaking up 1 bar of chocolate and mixing with black cocoa powder. When cutting the chocolate chip batter, they can easily crumble, so use a knife warmed with hot water or heat and then slice. Maple Shortbread Matcha Shortbread.

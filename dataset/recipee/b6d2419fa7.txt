Brown Rice With Fresh Oregano And Mushrooms Recipe


Ingredients


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 cup of mushrooms, white, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, oregano, dried


 - 1 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Saute/fry mushrooms and fresh oregano in extra virgin olive oil or possibly butter in nonstick pan for 1 minute. Remove from pan; reserve. Saute/fry rice in same pan, stirring constantly, till rice is well coated, about 2 min. Combine rice with water and salt in steaming pan; cover and steam till rice is done, 40 to 45 min. Toss reserved mushrooms with warm rice. Serve immediately. Variations:* Any fresh herb such as basil, thyme, cilantro or possibly a combination can be used. * For a nuttier texture, uncooked rice can also be toasted in a preheated 350 degree oven. Spread rice on a cookie sheet and toast, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 min till golden brown. Steam rice in the usual way. * Vary ingredients as you would in any rice. NOTES : Brown rice is high in nutrients. Sauteing it in extra virgin olive oil or possibly butter before steaming intensifies its nutty flavor.

Instructions: 

Note: Biscuit recipe has been adapted from The Better Homes and Garden Cookbook, 1976, Baking Powder Biscuits. For the biscuits: Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a medium size bowl. Add the butter into the sifted ingredients. Using a fork, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs. Then make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients. Add the milk into the well and mix it quickly with a fork until the dough sticks together. Sprinkle some flour onto a large cutting board. Add the dough to the cutting board and knead it gently about 10 times. Add a bit of flour to a rolling pin and roll the dough until its about 1/2 inch thick. Using a biscuit cutter (or the top of a glass), cut the dough into 6 circles. Reserve the scraps. Add the dough circles to an ungreased cookie sheet. Brush some softened butter over the top of the biscuits. Mix the sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl and then sprinkle it over the top of the buttered biscuit. Cut the raspberries in half lengthwise. Top each biscuit with 4 to 6 raspberry halves depending on the size of the berries. Sprinkle some of the cinnamon and sugar over the top of the berries. Roll out the remaining dough, and cut it into another 6 circles. Top each raspberry biscuit with one of the remaining dough circles (like a sandwich). Spread some softened butter on top of the biscuit dough circle. Then top with more cinnamon and sugar. Bake in preheated oven for about 12 minutes or until the biscuits turn a light golden color. Serve warm right out of the oven.

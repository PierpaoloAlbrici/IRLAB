Oat Flour Wraps/Tortillas


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of seasoning mix, dry, taco, original


 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Mix the first two ingredients together; stir in water, then feel for consistency (the dough should be soft, but not wet, and mold easily). As you stir, the dough will form a ball (add more water if necessary). Pinch off four balls of dough about the size of golf balls. Roll them in a little additional flour to coat well. Knead each ball a bit as you pat or roll it into a flat circle that is about 1/8 inch thick and 5 inches across. Heat a heavy frying pan or griddle (no oil or grease). Place each tortilla in the hot pan and cook for a few minutes on each side. Tortillas should become lightly brown and start to appear dry. Cool on wire racks. Store in the refrigerator up to 2 weeks or freeze.

Salt Crusted Potatoes with Fresh Rosemary


Ingredients


 - 4 pound of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, rosemary, dried


Instructions: 

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. 2. Place the potatoes in a large bowl (if you have overly large ones, cut them in half so all the potatoes are about 1-inch to 2 1/2-inches). Toss to coat with olive oil, salt, and rosemary so all the flavors are evenly distributed. 3. Transfer to a large, rimmed baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. 4. Turn the potatoes and continue to bake 18-22 minutes longer until they are fork tender. 5. Serve hot; some of my family avoid the salty skins and go straight for the creamy middle, but I love the combination of both. Recipe adapted slightly from a recipe sent to me by Emily B., a MKC reader.

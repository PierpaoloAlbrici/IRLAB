Instructions: 

Prep work: Soak the raisins marked in the hot water for about 30 - 40 minutes (See "Helpful Hints") The raisins marked will be used later so leave them on standby! Place the rehydrated raisins marked and the other ingredients (except the raisins marked ) in your bread maker and switch it on. If you are using non-Japanese flour, increase the amount of milk to 98 g. 5 minutes before the bread dough is done, add the raisins marked to the bread maker. Let the bread complete the first proof in the bread maker. This is a picture after the bread has completed first proofing. Punch the dough down, divide into 12 balls with the smooth side side facing up and let rest for 20 minutes. Carefully reform the balls and let rise until doubled in size. Bake in an oven preheated to 180C for 15 minutes and you're done. The baking time will depend on your oven, so adjust as necessary. Spread cream cheese and eat!

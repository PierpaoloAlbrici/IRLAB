Marie Burwell Hunt's English Brittle


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 2 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 8 ounce of candies, semisweet chocolate


Instructions: 

Melt the butter over low heat, then add the sugar and stir until the sugar has dissolved. When the butter-sugar mixture turns brown and melted, carefully pour it into a greased baking pan that has been sprinkled with some of the chopped almonds. When this has cooled completely melt the chocolate and pour this over the top, then sprinkle with the remaining nuts. Let this stand until it has completely cooled and is brittle. Then break up into small pieces.

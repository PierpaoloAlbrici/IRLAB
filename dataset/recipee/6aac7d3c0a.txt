Borscht (Sweet And Sour Cabbage Soup) Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


 - 1 cup of salt, table


 - 1/2 cup of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

This is an easy one. Place meat, bones, onions, carrots, and celery into 8 quart. large soup pot. Add in water, almost to top. Add in tomato puree. Add in salt and pepper. Bring to boil, then lower heat to simmer. Add in sugar and sour salt Or possibly lemon juice Or possibly vinegar. Cook till meat is tender. Taste it and adjust for sweet and sour to your family's liking. Add in more sugar if not sweet sufficient, more sour if too sweet. The first taste should almost make your mouth pucker. Remove meat. Add in sliced cabbage and potatoes, and bring soup back to boil, lower head again and cook till potatoes and cabbage are tender, around 25 min. You can serve this in either of two ways: (1) slice meat and remove potatoes from with slotted spoon. Serve the meat and potatoes on serving platters at the table. (2) Slice or possibly chunk meat and return to pot and serve up as a one dish meal. This is really yummy with a good dark pumpernickel bread. *Note. since this is a peasant type soup, the measurements do not need to be exact. Feel free to adjust the amounts to your own tastes and needs.

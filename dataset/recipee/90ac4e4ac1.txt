Coconut Sweets


Ingredients


 - 3 ounce of cheese, ricotta, whole milk


 - 14 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 5 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 14 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


Instructions: 

Grease an 8x8 inch square pan, set aside. In a large, nonstick fry pan heat ricotta cheese on medium heat. Add milk powder and stir to mix thoroughly. Cook for 12 to 15 minutes until most of the liquid is evaporated. Stir frequently to avoid sticking or burning on the bottom. Add sugar and stir. The ricotta cheese mixture will become liquid again. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the coconut and mix thoroughly. Continue to cook for 3 to 5 minutes. The mixture should be quite thick. Pour the mixture into the greased pan and press the mixture with a spatula. Cut into 1 x 1 inch diamond shapes. The mixture sets as it cools. Cool completely before removing from the pan.

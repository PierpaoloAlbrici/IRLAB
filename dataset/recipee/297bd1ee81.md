[297bd1ee81](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/nut-and-seed-granola.html)

### Ingredients

 - 1/4 cup of syrup, maple, canadian

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 1/2 cup of nuts, pecans

 - 1/4 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

 - 3 tablespoon of seeds, sunflower seed kernels, dried

 - 1 tablespoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

 - 1 tablespoon of seeds, flaxseed

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Position an oven rack at the bottom of the oven, and preheat to 325 degrees F. Whisk the maple syrup and oil together in a large bowl. Add the almonds, pecans, coconut, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, flaxseed and salt, and toss to coat. Spread the mixture out on a baking sheet, and bake for 20 minutes. Remove it from the oven, and scrape and toss the mixture around. Continue to bake until golden and still slightly sticky, 10 to 12 minutes more. Or, for a deeper, toasted version, bake until deeply golden (you may start to smell the toasted nuts), 13 to 15 minutes more. Let cool. (The granola can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.)

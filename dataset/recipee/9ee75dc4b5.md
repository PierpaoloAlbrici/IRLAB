### Ingredients

 - 4 pound of crustaceans, shrimp, raw (not previously frozen)

 - 16 ounce of crustaceans, crab, alaska king, imitation, made from surimi

### Instructions

In a stock pot, fill with enough water to cover the shrimp and bring to a boil. Add 1/2 bottle of Zataran's. Bring to a rolling boil and add 2 pounds of shrimp. Make sure to turn on your exhaust fan! Watch the pot for the first bubble after the shrimp have been added and set a timer for one minute. Get a second pot and place it in your sink with a colander over it. Once the timer goes off, remove the shrimp pot from the heat and pour over the colander catching the shrimp and reserving the cooking liquid in the pot below. Immediately ice down the shrimp to stop the cooking. Take the second pot with the seasoned water, put on the stove top and bring to a boil. Add the rest of the Zataran's and bring to a rolling boil. Repeat the timed cook, straining and ice down for the other two pounds of shrimp. Follow this method exactly, cooking the shrimp in batches, to yield the best results and to prevent coughing fits for anyone in the kitchen from breathing the "spicy" air!

Florentine Cookies


Ingredients


 - 6 ounce of butter, without salt


 - 3/4 cup of syrups, corn, light


 - 3/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 12 ounce of nuts, almonds


 - 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


Instructions: 

Preheat a convection oven to 325 degrees F, or preheat a regular oven to 350 degrees. Melt the butter in a medium-size heavy saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the corn syrup and sugar to the pan, increase the heat to medium, and cook until the syrup is simmering. Meanwhile, mix the almonds and flour in a small bowl, and then add them to the simmering syrup. Stir with a wooden spoon until well blended, and then remove from heat. Pour mixture into bowl, using a rubber spatula to scrape, and then let cool. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Form into 1-ounce balls for large cookies or 1/2-ounce balls for small cookies, placing them on the parchment paper 3 inches apart from each other, as they will spread drastically. Bake until just starting to turn golden brown, about 5 to 8 minutes. The baking time will vary depending on what size the cookies are. As soon as you remove the cookies from the oven, shape them into cups by molding each cookie around the bottom of a small cup or glass. They must still be warm to hold this shape.

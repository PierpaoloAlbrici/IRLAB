### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 18 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

Toss everything together. Drop by tablespoonfuls, 4" apart, onto a Silpat-lined baking sheet. Stir after each tablespoon, to keep flour evenly distributed. Spread each spoonful out to a 3-4" diameter circle. Bake in a preheated 375F oven for about 10 minutes until bubbly. Let cool a minute or two, then transfer very carefully to a rack to cool. You can also drape them over the bottom of a teacup to form a small bowl. Store in an airtight container, separated by layers of waxed paper, at room temperature, up to 3 days.

Cantaloupe, Strawberry and Coconut Gazpacho


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of melons, cantaloupe, raw


 - 2 cup of strawberries, raw


 - 1 teaspoon of sweetener, herbal extract powder from stevia leaf


 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1/4 teaspoon of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


Instructions: 

In a blender add cantaloupe and strawberries. Process until smooth. Add stevia or sugar to taste and combine. Place a fine mesh sieve over a bowl or line a bowl with cheesecloth and pour the fruit into the sieve or cheesecloth. With a back of a spoon, push the fruit through. You want to get rid of the seeds and pulp. Discard the pulp and seeds. Stir coconut milk and extract into the mixture in the bowl. Taste one more time to see if additional sugar is needed. Refrigerate until cold and serve within one day. You can freeze it and use it as a smoothie, if you are not going to use right away.

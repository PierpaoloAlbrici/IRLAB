Pickled Garlic


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of spices, garlic powder


 - 1 1/2 cup of vinegar, distilled


 - 12 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of dill weed, fresh


 - 1 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


Instructions: 

Bring vinegar, water and spices to a boil. Add garlic and bring back to a boil. Pour into clean, sterilized jars. Seal tight and store in cool place. Keep sealed for 3 weeks before using to get best flavor. * Separating garlic into cloves and soaking them for 2 or 3 hours (or overnight) makes the outer skin easier to remove.

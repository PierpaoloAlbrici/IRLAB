Instructions: 

In a food processor, combine the walnuts and pecans and pulse a few times, until the nuts are roughly chopped. Add the oats, cinnamon, and salt, and pulse just until the nuts are coarsely ground (be careful not to overprocess). Transfer 2/3 cup of the nut mixture to a small bowl and set aside. Add the coconut flour to the remaining mixture in the food processor and pulse until just combined. Add the dates, 2 to 3 at a time, pulsing between additions until each date is well-incorporated. Add the vanilla and 1/4 cup of the maple syrup and pulse until the mixture clumps together. Transfer the batter to an 8-inch square baking pan (lined with plastic wrap for easy removal, if desired), using your fingers or a spatula to press it firmly and evenly into the pan. Add the coconut palm sugar and remaining tablespoon of maple syrup to the reserved nut-oat mixture in the small bowl. Use a fork to stir it together until it becomes sticky. Scatter the streusel evenly on top of the cake in the pan, and firmly press it down with your fingers or the bottom of a cup. Refrigerate until ready to cut and serve. Store the squares in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week or in the freezer for up to a month.

### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of spices, ginger, ground

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 12 cup of lemon juice, raw

 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Peel and grate fresh ginger root (a little skin doesnt matter, it will be strained). Add to a small pot with sugar, lemons and water. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat. Let steep for 15 minutes to 1 hour, as desired. Strain the mixture. Add strained liquid to a pitcher and fill it the rest of the way with ice. This will cool it down and dilute it some. Serve over more ice, diluted with more water, to taste. Spicy hot and icy cold, heavenly!

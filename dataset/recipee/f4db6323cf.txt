Mexican Fiesta Dip Mix (In a Jar)


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of spices, parsley, dried


 - 13 cup of onions, raw


 - 14 cup of chives, raw


 - 13 cup of spices, chili powder


 - 14 cup of spices, cumin seed


 - 14 cup of salt, table


 - 1 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular


 - 1 cup of cream, sour, cultured


Instructions: 

In a large bowl, combine the spices and store in an airtight container. Attach this to the jar: Mexican Fiesta Dip. Makes two cups. In a medium mixing bowl combine 3 tablespoons of the Dip Mix with the mayonnaise and sour cream. Whisk the mixture until smooth. (Check if you want to add more of the Dip Mix or more mayo/sour cream. ). Refrigerate for 2-4 hours or overnight (best). If you do this at home and you have some fresh herbs around then add some. I like to add fresh chives, parsley or coriander. Serve with tortilla chips (works best! )or fresh vegetables.

### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of seeds, pumpkin and squash seeds, whole, roasted, without salt

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 6 ounce of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022

 - 1 1/2 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

### Instructions

Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper, or use a silicone baking sheet, and set aside. Heat pumpkin seeds in a medium frying pan over medium heat and toast until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Let cool slightly, then mix with cayenne until well blended; set aside. Melt chocolate and toffee bar in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly, until smooth. Remove from heat and mix in 3/4 of the pumpkin seed mixture. Spread chocolate mixture onto the lined baking sheet very thinly, into roughly a 12-by-10-inch rectangle. Sprinkle remaining pumpkin seed mixture over top. Let set in a cool, dry location. Once bark is hard, break up into shards. The bark should be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dry place, and will last up to 3 days. Serve with ice cream, optional.

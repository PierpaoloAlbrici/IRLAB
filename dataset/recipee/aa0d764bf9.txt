Williams Sonoma Vanilla Buttercream Frosting


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 8 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 pinch of salt, table


Instructions: 

Have all ingredients at room temperature. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the flat beater, beat together the confectioners' sugar, butter, the 2 tablespoons milk, the vanilla and salt on low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Increase the speed to medium and beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes. If the frosting is dry, add more milk, a tablespoon at a time, until it is creamy but still holds peaks.

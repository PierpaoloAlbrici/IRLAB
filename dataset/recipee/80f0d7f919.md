### Ingredients

 - 225 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 34 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 175 ml of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

### Instructions

In a big bowl combine flour, baking soda and salt. Make a well in the center. Add buttermilk and stir to combine. Knead into a smooth, shaggy dough. If the dough is too wet, add more flour, if it is too dry, add a tad more buttermilk. On a lightly floured surface roll into a ball. Place on a paper-lined baking sheet and slightly pat down. Make a cross on top using a sharp knife. Sprinkle some flour on top. Bake in the preheated oven at 200C/400F for about 25 minutes checking in near the end to prevent overbrowning. If a toothpick inserted in the centre comes out clean, it is ready. Alternatively you can tap it on the bottom and if it sounds hollow, it is ready. Remove to a wire rack to cool completely. This is best eaten the day it is made, but will keep wrapped in a clean tea towel for a few days.

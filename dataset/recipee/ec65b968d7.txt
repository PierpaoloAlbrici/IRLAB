Dolly's Crisp Toffee Bars


Ingredients


 - 12 pound of butter, without salt


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1 cup of sugars, brown


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 4 ounce of nuts, walnuts, english


 - 6 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

Adjust rack to the center of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, cream the butter with a mixer. Add the salt, vanilla, and sugar and beat well. On low speed, gradually add the flour, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula and beating until the mixture holds together. Add the nuts and chocolate chips and mix well. Spread the dough (it will be stiff) into an unbuttered 10 1/2 x 15 1/2 x 1 inch jelly roll pan. With floured fingertips, press the dough firmly to make an even layer- it will be thin. Bake for 25 minutes, reversing the pan front to back once to insure even baking. The cake will be golden brown. Let cool in the pan for only a minute or so. With a small sharp knife, cut into bars. Let stand in the pan until cool. Transfer the cookies to paper towels to dry the bottoms. Wrap individually in wax paper or store in an airtight container.

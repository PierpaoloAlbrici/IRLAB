Sort through dried pinto beans to remove any bad beans then rinse them well. Place in a heavy stock pot and cover the beans with water by at least 2 inches. Chop bacon and add it into the pan. Bring to a boil over medium high heat, stir, and allow to boil for about 2-3 minutes. Reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and allow beans to cook until tender and in its own thick broth. This will take about 2 hours. Then add seasonings, stir and allow to cook for just another minute or two with the spices. Serve with your favorite cornbread.

### Ingredients

 - 2 quart of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

 - 1 quart of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 12 cup of vinegar, cider

### Instructions

Combine milks in crockpot. Turn on low and add acid agent. Stir well. Cook six to eight hours (the longer cooking time will start to add a bit of color to the cheese); it is very subjective and dependent on your crockpot, so watch carefully. The curd should be solid, and it should have a good cooked-milk smell. Turn off the crockpot and wrap the whole thing in several layers of towels. Let stand undisturbed for another 6-8 hours. Line a colander or mesh strainer with damp paper towels or damp cheesecloth. Spoon the curd into the colander and let drain; you can reserve the whey for various purposes (roses love it) or discard it. Don't rush the draining if you want a thick, soft cheese. Pack into containers; you can stir in flavorings or salt before packing if so desired. It will stay fresh for about 4 days, up to 7 days in a very cold refrigerator.

Sweet Butter Carrots


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of carrots, raw


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 14 cup of butter, without salt


 - 13 cup of sugars, brown


Instructions: 

Cook carrots in a large pot of boiling water with salt until tender. Drain off most of the liquid, leaving about an inch of water in the bottom of the pan. Set the carrots aside. Add butter and brown sugar to the water. Stir until the butter melts. Return carrots to the pot and stir well. Cover and let simmer for 10 minutes to allow flavors to mingle.

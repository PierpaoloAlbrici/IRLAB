### Ingredients

 - 18 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 12 cup of vinegar, distilled

 - 13 cup of catsup

 - 1 tablespoon of sauce, worcestershire

 - 12 teaspoon of mustard, prepared, yellow

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, paprika

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, curry powder

 - 12 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 2 pound of chicken, broiler or fryers, breast, skinless, boneless, meat only, raw

### Instructions

Combine the first 10 ingredients in a resealable plastic bag or shallow glass container; mix well. Rinse and dry the chicken thighs and add to the marinade (I did not do this but I suggest setting some of the marinade aside so that you can baste the chicken toward the end of the cooking time). Seal or cover and refrigerate for 1-2 hours. Place the chicken in a shallow baking pan and spoon additional marinade on top of chicken. Cover with foil and bake at 400 degrees for 35 minutes. Uncover, spoon reserved marinade on chicken and continue baking uncovered for an additional 10 minutes. Remove from oven and let sit for 5 minutes.

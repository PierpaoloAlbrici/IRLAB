### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of oats

 - 1 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt

 - 2 tablespoon of beverages, protein powder whey based

 - 2 tablespoon of seeds, flaxseed

### Instructions

Grind 1/3 of the oats in a blender. Combine ground oats, whole oats, crisp rice cereal, protein powder, and ground flax seed in a bowl. In a microwave safe bowl, mix together brown sugar, peanut butter, and honey. Heat in the microwave for 30 seconds. Take the bowl out of the microwave and stir it up. Then heat it again in the microwave for another 15-30 seconds or until everything is melted and combined. Pour liquid mixture into dry mixture and stir to combine. Add chocolate chips and stir again. Press mixture into an 8x8 square dish that has been lined with parchment paper (with about 6 inches overhang on each side). Press down pretty hard using the parchment paper (over the top). Pop in the fridge for at least an hour. Cut into your preferred size bars and wrap individually in plastic wrap. Keep them in a plastic bag in the fridge for easy and quick on-the-go snacking.

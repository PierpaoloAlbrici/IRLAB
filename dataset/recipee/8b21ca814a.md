### Ingredients

 - 34 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 34 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 34 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 23 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Combine flours, yeast and salt. Mix well. Combine water and oil. Add to flour-mixture, stir to blend. Knead dough on a flour-coated counter, adding more flour as needed. (or water if it seems too dry). When dough is "soft", shape in to a ball and roll in flour. Transfer to a big bowl and cover. Let stand in refrigerator overnight. Next day knead dough 1 min., then let it rest for 10-30 minutes. Roll out and place on a flour-coated baking sheet. (I usually pre-bake the dough for 8-10 minutes at 400F).

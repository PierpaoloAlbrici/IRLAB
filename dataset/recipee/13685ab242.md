### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

 - 1 tablespoon of honey

 - 1 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 34 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 34 cup of butter, without salt

 - 23 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 tablespoon of nuts, pistachio nuts, raw

### Instructions

Scatter the sesame seeds on a baking sheet and toast in a 350-degree oven until a light golden brown. Combine the honey with the (1 tbsp.) water and use to moisten the sesame seeds. Spread in a saucer. Stir together the flour, baking powder, and sugar. Cut in the butter, as if you were making pie crust dough. Gradually add the (2/3 cup) water until the dough is smooth. Form balls of dough the size of walnuts and dip one side of each ball into the sesame seed mixture to coat. The bottom side may be very lightly touched to the pistachios. Place on greased baking sheets, sesame side up. Bake at 350 for 15-20 minutes, until golden brown.

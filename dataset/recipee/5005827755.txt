Red Berry Sundae Sauce


Ingredients


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 cup of raspberries, raw


 - 1 cup of strawberries, raw


Instructions: 

Put the sugar and 1/4 cup water into a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Cook, swirling the pan, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Put the raspberries and strawberries into a blender jar and pour the hot sugar syrup over them. Puree the berries just until liquefied. Pour the mixture through a fine mesh strainer set over a bowl to strain out the seeds. Transfer the sauce to a pitcher and pour over ice cream or sliced pound cake. Store the leftover sauce in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

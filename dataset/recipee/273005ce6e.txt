Meat marinade (My favorite)


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)


 - 1/3 cup of sauce, worcestershire


 - 5 tablespoon of vinegar, balsamic


 - 1/4 cup of honey


 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

Whisk all ingredients together Season meat to your liking- I use salt,pepper,onion & garlic powder. Marinade seasoned meat and put in the fridge for at least 1 hour-the longer it sits the better. Grill your meat and enjoy.

Rosemary Almonds


Ingredients


 - 12 pound of nuts, almonds


 - 34 pound of nuts, almonds


 - 2 tablespoon of spices, rosemary, dried


 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 2 teaspoon of sugars, brown


 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Spread the almonds in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast at 350F until they become fragrant and lightly toasted- about 8- 10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the remaining ingredients in a large bowl (big enough to hold all of the almonds). When the almonds are toasted done, toss them immediately with the rosemary mixture (while they are still hot! ). Toss thoroughly. Let cool, and toss again to break them up a bit (the sugar will cause them to stick together until they cool, then they will stay separate). Store in an airtight container or serve slightly warm. NOTE: You can substitute any kind of nut, or a mix of nuts. Just make sure the nuts are raw and unsalted. You need about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds of nuts in total.

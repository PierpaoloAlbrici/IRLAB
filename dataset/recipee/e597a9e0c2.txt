Baking Bread Straight from Liquid Bread Starter - Simple and Basic Rolls


Ingredients


 - 160 g of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 50 g of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 65 g of water, bottled, generic


 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 10 g of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Combine all of the ingredients in a bowl except for the unsalted butter, bring it together into a ball and place it on a work surface to knead. Knead the butter into the dough. Press the dough down on the work surface and knead it for 5 minutes in a motion resembling washing with a wash board. Once the dough comes together, knead by pressing and pulling it in a "V" along your work surface while putting your weight into it. Seal the underside once the surface is no longer rough and the ingredients have combined evenly, and smooth out the surface. Place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. The first proofing is complete once it has doubled in size. (For those concerned about drying out the dough, place it into a plastic bag or Styrofoam container with a cup of lukewarm water and let it rise.) Divide into 6 equal portions with a scraper. Gently stretch out the dough to release the air, then roll each portion into a ball. Sprinkle with a bit of flour if they stick to your hands. Flip the bowl that you used for the proofing over top of the dough to prevent it from drying out, and let it rise for 20 minutes. Gently release more gas from the dough and roll them back into a round ball. Arrange them with the seams down on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Place the whole pan into a large plastic bag along with a cup of lukewarm water to prevent it from drying out, and let it rise for the second time. The second proofing is done once they double in size. Bake in an oven preheated to 190C for 14 minutes. (Adjust the heat according to your oven. They will bake more evenly on a round pan. They're done! They taste good as is, but you can also cut them in half and eat them with condensed milk cream. Or, as hamburger buns. I eat them with roast beef. Or bake them with an anko (sweet adzuki bean paste) filling. Layer the top with cookie dough for a "melon" bread. Or, without dividing up the dough, roll it into a flat square, spread on some cream cheese, roll it up into a log, then cut it into 6 pieces and bake. Knead in a few more grams of water, then add dried blueberries right before you complete the kneading, then let it rise. The berries will be nice and plump when you take that first bite. Here it is with a sweet peanut cream filling and topped with almonds. I baked it as a danish-type roll. Here they are baked topped with wieners, leftover curry, and melting cheese. Since the dough is not too sweet, it goes well with savory toppings. Here it is after cutting the dough in half and baking them in miniature pound cake molds with a sugared or buttered top. Right before baking, slash the tops with one shallow cut along the top, then arrange finely diced pats of butter along the top.

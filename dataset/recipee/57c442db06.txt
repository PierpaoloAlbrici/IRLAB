Cultured Sour Cream


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized


 - 5 teaspoon of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Place 1 cup (225 ml) of cream in a sterilized jar. Add the buttermilk. Close jar. Shake vigerously. Stir in second cup of cream. Cover jar and allow to stand at 75 to 80 degrees (25 C.) for 24 hours.

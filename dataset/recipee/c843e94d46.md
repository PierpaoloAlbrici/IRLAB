### Ingredients

 - 2 quart of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1/4 cup of lemon juice, raw

### Instructions

In a heavy-bottomed pot, slowly bring the milk and the lemon juice to 200 degrees F. Remove from heat and cover. Place in a spot where the temperature will remain uniform, we suggest an unheated oven. After 6 hours, strain the curds and whey through cheesecloth. Tie the corners of the cloth to form a bag and hang it to drain overnight.

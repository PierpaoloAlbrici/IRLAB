Honey & Milk Fluffy White Rolls


Ingredients


 - 90 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 90 g of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 20 g of wheat flour, white, cake, enriched


 - 145 ml of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 20 g of honey


 - 1 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 3 g of salt, table


 - 3 g of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


 - 10 g of butter, without salt


Instructions: 

Mix the dry ingredients marked together. Put all of the ingredients,except the butter, in the bread-maker. Turn on the dough mode setting. Add the yeast according to the manufacturer's instructions. Add the butter after the dough has been kneading for 5 minutes. Leave the rest to the bread maker. When the dough is ready, take it out of the bread-maker and gently punch it down. Divide the dough into 6 portions and roll into balls. The dough is rather soft, so dust with flour, if needed. Each ball is should be about 65 g. Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let rise for 15 minutes. Punch the balls down with a rolling pin, dust with flour from strainer, and roll into balls again. Indent the middle of the balls firmly with a chopstick. Press the balls firmly to the bottom, but be careful not to press them too hard, or they may break apart after rising. Use the bread rising setting of your oven and let rise for 40 minutes. The photo shows the rolls after the second rising. Preheat the oven to 180C, lower the heat to 160C and bake for 10 minutes. Lower the heat again to 140C and bake for 5 minutes. The total baking time is 15 minutes. If they seem to be browning too quickly, cover with a sheet of foil. I covered mine after about 8 minutes. They tend to wrinkle when they're cool, but if you want to make really white rolls, cover them with foil soon after putting them in the oven. But even then they will get a little bit wrinkled. They're best eaten right out of the oven, but they're still good eaten later, if you put them in a plastic bag while slightly warm. They're really good with blueberry jam or with egg salad.

Basic Jam


Ingredients


 - 2 pound of plums, raw


 - 4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/4 cup of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

Mash fruit and sugar together in large, nonreactive bowl. Stir in lemon juice, and let stand 15 minutes. Place 1 or 2 small white saucers in freezer. Transfer fruit to nonreactive sauce-pan. Simmer 5 to 15 minutes over medium-low heat, or until thickened, stirring often. As jam thickens, bubbles will get larger and slower to pop. Remove 1 saucer from freezer. Test consistency by spooning some jam onto saucer, and returning it to freezer for 2 minutes. If dollop holds together and does not have a watery ring around edges, its ready to put in jars. If jam is still watery, cook 3 to 5 minutes longer. Repeat testing process if necessary. Remove jam from heat. Ladle into 8-oz. jars, leaving 1/4-inch headroom. Wipe off any drips, then screw on tops. Invert jars 5 minutes, or immerse in boiling water bath 10 minutes.

### Ingredients

 - 2 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 pound of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 cup of rice flour, white, unenriched

 - 12 pound of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

### Instructions

Spread the all-purpose flour on a cookie sheet and place under a pre-heated broiler about 4-5 inches from the element. Roast the flour, watching it all the time until it is medium brown. Turn the flour with a spatula to brown the other side. The entire procedure takes about three minutes and gives the flour a rich nutty flavour. Let the flour cool. Mix the soft butter with the fruit sugar and add the sifted rice flour. Fold in the roasted flour and blend well. Chop the chocolate into chunks just a little smaller than a sugar cube. Mix them into the dough, taking care you don't soften the chocolate too much. Shape as desired. Bake at 300F for 1 hour. Cool, then store in an airtight container. Yield depends upon size and shape.

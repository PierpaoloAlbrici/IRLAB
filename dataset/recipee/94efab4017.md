### Ingredients

 - 3 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 14 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 teaspoon of vinegar, distilled

### Instructions

Sift the baking powder into the flour, make a well in the center and add water, 1 tablespoon of the butter, salt, sugar and vinegar. Knead to a smooth elastic consistency. Cut into 6 equal portions,and allow to "rest" in a cool place for 20 minutes Flatten each piece to a 6-inch round. Brush each round with the melted butter, then roll it into a tight sausage shape Allow the rolls to rest for 20 minutes. Repeat the flattening,rolling and brushing procedure twice more, waiting 20 minutes between rolling and re-flattening (final results should be flat like pita). Using a non-stick skillet/frying pan, fry the malawah on both sides until golden brown, flipping them over at half time.

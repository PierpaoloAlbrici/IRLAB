### Ingredients

 - 6 tablespoon of seeds, sunflower seed kernels, dried

 - 6 tablespoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

 - 10 tablespoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

 - 2 tablespoon of vanilla extract

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 3 tablespoon of sweetener, syrup, agave

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 3 tablespoon of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt

 - 2 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

### Instructions

Grind the sunflower seeds, sesame seeds separately. Add to your food processor. Grind the cocoa nibs up and take out 5 tablespoons These are for coating the truffles. Add the rest of the ingredients and process until the dough holds together well. Transfer the dough to a bowl and roll into little balls. I found that I had to squeeze the dough a few times to get it to stick together. Roll the truffles in the reserved ground cocoa powder you made and put into the fridge for at least an hour to set up. Bon Appetit.

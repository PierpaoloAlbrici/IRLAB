### Ingredients

 - 1/2 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping

 - 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 2 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

### Instructions

In a small saucepan, heat the cream just until small bubbles appear around the edge. In a medium saucepan, cook the sugar with the water over high heat until the sugar is dissolved, washing down the side of the pan with a wet pastry brush. Continue cooking, without stirring, until a light honey-colored caramel forms, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and carefully stir in the scalded cream. Let cool for 1 minute, then stir in the vanilla. Serve warm.

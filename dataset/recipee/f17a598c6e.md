Pour about 1 inch of water into a large frying pan and bring it to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, cut off the tough bottom ends from the aspargus. Generously salt the water. Add in the aspargus, return the water to a boil and cook till the aspargus is just tender, about 3 min. Drain the aspargus and rinse under cool running water. Drain well and pat dry.

Place the bowl in the middle of a round platter and fan the asparagus spears on the platter around it.

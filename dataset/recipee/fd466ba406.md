### Ingredients

 - 13 ounce of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)

 - 18 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 2 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/2 cup of syrup, maple, canadian

 - 1/2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 250 F. Pour the hulless popcorn into a large roasting pan that has been lightly sprayed with non-stick cooking spray. In a medium-sized saucepan, bring butter, sugar, salt and syrup to a gentle boil over medium high heat. Boil for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in baking soda. The caramel will foam up a bit and lighten in color. Stir to combine. When well blended, pour caramel over the hulless popcorn and stir gently to coat all pieces. Bake the caramel corn in a 250 F oven for 1 hour, stirring well every 15 minutes. Remove from oven and stir once more; allow to cool. Popcorn stores well in an airtight container.

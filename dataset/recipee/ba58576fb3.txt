Perfect Homemade Popcorn


Ingredients


 - 6 tablespoon of corn, sweet, white, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, canola


 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Add the kernels and oil into a pot with a lid and turn the heat up to medium high. Leave the lid off until you start to hear a slight sizzle. Place the lid over the pot and when you hear the first few kernels pop and turn the heat down to medium. Turn off the heat once you hear the popping slow down a bit, about 1-2 minutes. Let the pot rest for about one minute before removing the lid. Transfer the popcorn into a large bowl and sprinkle the popcorn salt over the first few ladlefuls of popcorn. Continue to add the popcorn to the bowl and season the top with a little more popcorn salt before serving. Side note: it is very important that you use popcorn salt. Popcorn salt is just salt that is very fine, but because it is so fine, it sticks to the popcorn. Regular salt wont stick to the kernel and youll have bland popcorn. Another good thing to know is this popcorn keeps well in a ziplock bag for about a week.

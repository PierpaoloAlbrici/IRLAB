### Ingredients

 - 5 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 6 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 13 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Mix flour, baking powder, salt, and 1/2 of RawSpiceBars sumac spice & herbs together. Slowly pour in the olive oil, mixing while pouring. Add the warm water and mix again until the dough comes together into a ball. Knead dough continuously for 5-10 minutes. Add flour to coat as you go along and continuously fold the dough in half from either side; the dough will be firm and this is normal. Once kneaded, allow to rest for 10-15 minutes. Transfer the risen dough onto a floured surface. Punch to allow accumulated air to escape. Divide the dough into 10 pieces, forming each into a ball. sing the heels of your hands, flatten the balls from either side. Use your thumb and index finger to fully flatten and stretch the dough into a 6 diameter. Turn the grill or cast iron pan, if you have one, to medium high heat. Brush with oil. Add the flatbreads a few at a time, allowing space between each. Leave for 2-3 minutes until golden brown and slightly puffy on either side.

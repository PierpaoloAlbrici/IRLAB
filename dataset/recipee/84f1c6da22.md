### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of oats

 - 2 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

 - 2 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 1 1/2 cup of cherries, sweet, raw

 - 1/2 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Toss the oats, coconut, almonds, and cherries together in a large bowl. Pour the vegetable oil and honey over the oat mixture. Add the cinnamon, and stir with a wooden spoon until all the oats and nuts are coated with the liquids. Pour onto a sheet pan. Bake, stirring occasionally with a spatula, until the mixture turns a nice, even golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the granola from the oven and allow to cool, stirring occasionally. Store the cooled granola in an airtight container.

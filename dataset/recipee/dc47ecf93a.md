### Ingredients

 - 12 ounce of oil, corn, peanut, and olive

 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 tablespoon of honey

 - 1 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 pinch of spices, cinnamon, ground

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 F. Line a rimmed baking tray with aluminum foil or parchment paper and set aside. If you prefer, you can remove the skin on the peanuts (this will make for a more smooth final texture). In a medium mixing bowl, combine peanuts with salt and honey. Using a spoon, mix well so that all the peanuts are evenly coated. Lay peanuts out evenly and in one layer over the baking tray. Roast for 15-20 minutes, or until well-browned and dark, but not burnt. Halfway though, toss peanuts using a spatula. This will ensure even roasting. Remove from oven and allow to sit for 5 minutes. Add peanuts into a food processor and run it for 1 minute. Remove the lid and press the peanuts back down along the sides using a spatula. Replace the lid and turn food processor back on for an additional two minutes. Repeat with spatula if needed. The consistency of the peanuts will change but dont worry. After two minutes, slowly drizzle the oil into the food processor while it is running. Process until smooth, about 1-2 more minutes. Adjust flavor as desired by adding more salt, honey or even a pinch of cinnamon. Place in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 2 months. Note: If you prefer a quicker method, skip the roasting of the peanuts and buy a pack of honey-roasted peanuts instead.

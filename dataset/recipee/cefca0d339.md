[cefca0d339](http://www.food.com/recipe/grape-butter-130145)

### Ingredients

 - 4 quart of grapes, red or green (european type, such as thompson seedless), raw

 - 1 quart of apples, raw, with skin

 - 3 quart of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

Mash grapes and cook in a large saucepan. Press through a sieve back into the saucepan. Add apples and sugar; cook until thick. Plum butter may be cooked in the same way. This is the whole recipe. I think directions on ball may come in handy.

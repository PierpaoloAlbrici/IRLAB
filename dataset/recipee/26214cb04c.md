### Ingredients

 - 2 1/2 pound of potatoes, raw, skin

 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 14 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

### Instructions

Boil potatoes until tender. Drain well and return to pan and stir over low heat, a few minutes, to dry the potatoes, being careful not to brown them. Mash potatoes using a potato ricer, and place in heavy-duty electric mixer bowl. Add the remaining ingredients, except the flour for rolling and dusting, mix well. Blend together to form a nonsticky dough. Knead and form in a smooth log. Divide into 24 pieces. Roll each piece into a 8-10" circle. Turn the lefse as you roll it and keep it well coated with flour to prevent sticking. The dough is soft, but try to use as little flour as possible. Preheat an electric griddle or frying pan to 375 degrees, or use a griddle or frying pan over medium heat. Lightly grease with oil. Shake excess flour off each circle of lefse and place it in the pan. It will start to bubble; cook until the bubbles are lightly browned, about 1 1/2 minutes. With a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Stack the lefse on a wire rack as they are cooked, or wrap them in foil and keep warm in a 200 degree oven. They can be frozen and quickly reheated in the frying pan or on the griddle.

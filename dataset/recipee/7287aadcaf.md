### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 34 cup of sugars, powdered

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 2 tablespoon of honey

 - 2 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 325F/165C Have ready two baking sheets, with parchment to match. Whisk dry ingredients together in a medium bowl. Using a pastry blender or your fingertips, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until crumbly. In a separate bowl, stir the honey into the milk to dissolve. Add the liquid ingredients to the dry, tossing with a fork until it comes together. If it seems to require more liquid to come together, add a little extra milk. Turn the dough onto a well-floured surface and fold it over gently 10-12 times until smooth (I found a metal bench scraper to be quite helpful here). Divide the dough in half, and form each half roughly into a rectangular shape. Work with one half at a time, keeping the other half covered. On the counter, lightly flour one of your parchment sheets and a rolling pin. Roll one piece of dough on the parchment, adding a little more flour as necessary, into a rectangle about 10&#8243; X 14&#8243; (almost the size of your parchment). The dough should be about 1/16&#8243; thick. Trim the edges to make a clean rectangle and dock evenly with a fork. Using a pizza or pastry wheel, cut the dough into 16 rectangles. Lift the parchment onto your baking sheet. There is no need to separate the cookies they will bake together, but will break apart easily along the pre-cut lines when slightly cooled. Repeat the last two steps for your other half of dough. Bake for 15 minutes, or until medium gold all over (mine took a little longer). Let the crackers cool on the pan until just barely warm. Carefully snap crackers apart and cool them completely on a rack, before wrapping them tightly for storage.

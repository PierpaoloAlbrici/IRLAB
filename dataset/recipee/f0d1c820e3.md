### Ingredients

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, anise seed

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, fennel seed

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, cinnamon, ground

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, cloves, ground

 - 2 tablespoon of corn, sweet, white, raw

### Instructions

1. In a spice grinder or with a mortar and pestle, combine all ingredients (in batches if necessary); grind until mixture becomes a fine powder. Store in an airtight container for up to 6 months. My update Note: I play with this and ended up mixing half of this with a half cup of brown sugar and rubbing it on raw chicken. I then sprinkled soy sauce over the top. Considering that chinese five spice is so expensive, it's really better that I can make it at home. This way, I'm not out seven dollars for a spice I might only use a couple of times. I made a variation from the original and added a tablespoon of powdered ginger to the mix instead of the pepper. hope this helps somebody.

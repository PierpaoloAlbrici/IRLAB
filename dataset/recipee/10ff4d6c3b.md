### Ingredients

 - 15 ounce of lemon juice, raw

 - 3 1/2 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 3 ounce of pectin, unsweetened, dry mix

### Instructions

Have ready 4 sterilized half-pint jars, lids, and screw bands. In a non-reactive sauce pan over medium high heat, bring lemon juice and sugar to a boil; continue to boil for 1 full minute (remove any foam that formscooks treat!). Stir in liquid pectin, remove from heat, and immediately ladle hot jelly into prepared jars. Be sure the rims of the jars are clean before you add the lids and finger-tighten screw bands. Process in a hot water bath for 5 minutes. Label and enjoy! Note: If you dont have vanilla sugar, you can substitute 3 1/2 cups of granulated sugar plus the seeds of one vanilla bean.

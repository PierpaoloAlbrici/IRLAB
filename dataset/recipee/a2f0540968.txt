Instructions: 

Bread Mix---------. Mix well in a large tub or bowl. If you like herbs in your bread, add 2 T sweet basil, or a mix of Italian herbs. Mix well with a wire whisk. Then put in plastic containers to store. To Bake----------------. Mix and blend well. No need to knead, just mix well, until the dough is smooth, makes a firm ball, and is not sticky. If sticky, add some more flour until it's firm. Put it in the refrigerator and let it sit for a day. If you don't have a day, let it rise for a couple of hours, punching it down when it doubles. This will develop a much better flavor and crust. If your in a hurry the dough can go into the oven as soon as you roll it out, and let it rise for 15 minutes. This is a very forgiving recipe so don't worry. Now when your ready to bake, separate the dough into 3 pieces. With a little flour scattered on your counter, roll each piece of dough out into a circle about 1/2 inch thick. Set on greased baking sheets. Then let the dough proof or raise for 15 minutes. Then put your fingers into the dough, making some impressions, brush with melted butter or olive oil, and then very lightly with Italian sauce. Get creative with your toppings if you want. Parmesan, and fresh rosemary are great. Bake at 375 for 15 to 20 minutes until nicely browned and crusty. The bottom should be brown as well. Brush again with melted butter or olive oil. Now when the bread has cooled, wrap in plastic wrap completely, and freeze.

Chocolate Caramel-Nut Popcorn


Ingredients


 - 24 cup of snacks, popcorn, air-popped (unsalted)


 - 3 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 12 cup of syrups, corn, light


 - 12 cup of syrups, corn, light


 - 23 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 12 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 12 ounce of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 1 cup of nuts, almonds


Instructions: 

Spread popcorn in 2 large, deep roasting pans. Bring sugar, corn syrups and water to boil in 4-quart saucepan. Add butter and cook, stirring occasionally, until a candy thermometer registers 300 degrees F to 310 degrees F. When mixture forms hard, brittle threads, it's ready. Remove from heat. Carefully stir in salt, baking soda and vanilla extract. Because the candy is very hot, the vanilla extract will spatter and the mixture will foam. Pour over popcorn and stir to coat. Let cool. Store airtight. Up to 2 days before giving, break up large chunks, spread coated popcorn on two cookie sheets. Melt chocolate chips according to package directions. Drizzle over popcorn and, before chocolate hardens, sprinkle with almonds. Let stand at room temperature until chocolate hardens. Store airtight.

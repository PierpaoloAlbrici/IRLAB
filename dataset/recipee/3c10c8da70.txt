Healthier Peanut Butter Balls


Ingredients


 - 3/4 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 1/4 cup of honey


 - 3 tablespoon of wheat germ, crude


 - 18 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 3/4 cup of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


 - 3/4 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


 - 1 teaspoon of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)


Instructions: 

Mix together peanut butter and honey in a mixing bowl. Add wheat germ and salt and stir. Add coconut flour 1 heaping tablespoon at a time, adjusting the amount to get a dough that sticks together. Using a small cookie scoop, dish out each ball onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Put in freezer for 10 minutes to set. While balls are setting in the freezer, melt chocolate with coconut oil. I use a Crock-Pot Little Dipper to melt mine, which keeps the chocolate from scalding and eliminates the risk of water ruining the chocolate by double boiling. Remove balls from freezer. Dip each one into the chocolate and set on the tray. Freeze for 10 minutes to set.

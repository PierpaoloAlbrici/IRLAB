Parmesan Crisps


Ingredients


 - 7 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, chili powder


 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black


Instructions: 

Preheat the oven to 180 degC. Mix the ingredients together in a bowl. Line a baking tray with parchment paper, or a silicone mat if you have one. Heap tablespoons of the mixture into little piles on the baking tray. Make sure that the piles are relatively flat but the parmesan is not too far apart. This ensures they cook evenly and remain whole once cooked. Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Once it stops bubbling, transfer it to a wire rack to cool.

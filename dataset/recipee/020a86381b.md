### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 12 cup of butter, without salt

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

In a mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Using a pastry blender or two forks, cut butter into the flour mixture until it resembles course crumbs. Add water and stir gently, taking care not to overmix, which will toughen the biscuts. The dough will be quite sticky. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and quickly knead 5 or 6 times. Roll or pat out dough to approximately 1-inch thickness. Cut out using a floured round biscuit cutter. Place on an ungreased baking pan and bake in a preaheated 375F oven for 18-20 minutes, or until golden brown.

Salted, Roasted & Buttered Peanuts


Ingredients


 - 1/2 tablespoon of butter, salted


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 cup of oil, corn, peanut, and olive


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 350 F. Put a medium sized saucepan on medium-low heat. Add butter and allow it to melt. Add salt and stir to dissolve salt in melted butter. Remove from heat. Pour peanuts into a mixing bowl and drizzle the salt and butter mixture over the top. Mix thoroughly, using your hands. Place baking paper on a cookie sheet and spread peanuts over it. Bake for 10 minutes. By then they should be beautifully brown and crispy. Be careful to not burn them. Enjoy! Note: If you cant find un-shelled peanuts or if you are facing difficulty removing the shells from shell-on peanuts, place them in the fridge overnight. The shell should then easily peel off.

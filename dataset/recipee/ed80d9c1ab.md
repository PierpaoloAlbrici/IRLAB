### Ingredients

 - 2 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, brown

 - 1 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 tablespoon of spices, caraway seed

 - 2 1/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

### Instructions

Blend all ingredients together, knead for 7-10minutes, by hand or machine. Your dough should be smooth and a bit sticky,as that is the nature of rye bread dough. Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth or lightly oiled (I use cooking spray) cling film. Let rise until doubled, about an hour, maybe longer depending on the room temperature Gently deflate, and form as you like. Free form or in a bread pan. I bake it free form, on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Preheat the oven to 375, and let the bread rise until it is almost doubled. Slash with a sharp exacto , a lame or a serrated knife. Every method works, but I prefer an exacto. Spritz with water and place in the hot oven. Bake for 15 minutes, turn the pan for even browning and bake for 15 minutes more, or until the internal temperature is 190 or sounds hollow when tapped. * Or you can throw all the ingredients in a bread machine set on the dough cycle, let rise in the machine and then continue with above instructions.

[b0217c18ab](http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/main-courses/my-version-of-raising-canes-sauce/)

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular

 - 1/2 cup of catsup

 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of sauce, worcestershire

### Instructions

Mix everything together in a bowl and you are ready to go! ! I play around with the salt and Worcestershire depending on the brands of mayo and ketchup that I use. I have found that if I use off brands, things dont taste quite right. Use this dip for dipping fried chicken strips or french fries!

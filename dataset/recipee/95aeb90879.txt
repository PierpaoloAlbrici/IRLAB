Grape and Quinoa Salad


Ingredients


 - 1 1/4 cup of soup, vegetable broth, ready to serve


 - 1 cup of quinoa, uncooked


 - 2 cup of grapes, red or green (european type, such as thompson seedless), raw


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 2 tablespoon of vinegar, balsamic


 - 4 ounce of cheese, feta


 - 13 cup of currants, zante, dried


 - 13 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 14 cup of parsley, fresh


 - 1 tablespoon of shallots, raw


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 375F. Prepare the quinoa by bringing the chicken broth to a boil. Add quinoa, reduce heat to low, and cover. Simmer until quinoa is tender and broth is absorbed, about 12-15 minutes. Fluff quinoa. Combine grapes, 1 T olive oil, and 1 T balsamic vinegar and toss to coat. Spread grapes out on a rimmed baking sheet (it develops some liquid) and bake 10-12 minutes. Allow to cool. Combine quinoa, grapes and their liquid, feta cheese, dried currants, slivered almonds, parsley, and shallot, and mix well. Combine remaining 1 T olive oil and 1 T balsamic vinegar in a small bowl and whisk until well combined. Drizzle oil and vinegar mixture over quinoa and toss to coat. Serve room temperature or chilled.

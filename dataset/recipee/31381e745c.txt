Sweet Watermelon Ice [ Native American]


Ingredients


 - 3 cup of watermelon, raw


 - 3 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


Instructions: 

Pour the watermelon juice into a shallow glass baking dish. Add the sugar and lemon juice and stir well. Place the dish in the freezer and chill. Remove the pan every 1/2 hour and stir. The juice will form light, grainy ice crystals as it freezes. Repeat this process until the juice is fully frozen, about 4 hours, depending on the temperature of your freezer. You can also use an ice cream maker, following the manufacturer's directions. Serve immediately, or store in the freezer in a covered container up to several weeks. Number of servings depend on how hungry you are.

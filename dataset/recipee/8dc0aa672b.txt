 - 12 cup of delallo, italian seasoned breadcrumbs, upc: 072368104621


 - 12 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard


Instructions: 

Preheat Oven to 425F. Mix chicken tenders and mayonnaise in a bowl to lightly coat chicken with mayonnaise. Mix bread crumbs and cheese in a gallon-size zippie bag. Prepare baking sheet with cooking spray. Put 1-2 chicken tenders in the zippie bag with the bread crumbs and shake to coat. Place chicken tenders in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Continue until all tenders are coated and on the baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 8 minutes. Gently flip each one, so as not to remove the breading, and bake an additional 8 minutes. Serve with your favorite dipping sauce.

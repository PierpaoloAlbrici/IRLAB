### Ingredients

 - 200 g of oats

 - 0.5 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 0.5 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 50 g of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Pre-heat the oven to 170C/gas mark 3. Place the oatmeal, salt and baking powder in a bowl and stir. Melt the butter in 50ml/2fl oz boiling water, combine this with the oats and mix briefly to form a fairly stiff dough. Sprinkle some oatmeal (fine or medium) over a board and gently roll out the mixture thinly to a circle, about 23cm/9in diameter. Cut into eight wedges and transfer these carefully to a buttered oven tray. Bake for about 20 minutes until just firm. Transfer carefully to a wire rack to cool.

Berry Rice Krispies Treats


Ingredients


 - 6 cup of cereals, oats, regular and quick, unenriched, cooked with water (includes boiling and microwaving), without salt


 - 14 ounce of strawberries, raw


 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1/2 teaspoon of raspberries, raw


 - 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 1/2 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966


Instructions: 

Line a 9x13 metal cake pan with tin foil, and coat with non-stick cooking spray; set aside. Place the cereal in a very large mixing bowl. Use scissors to cut 1-cup of the heart shaped marshmallows into small pieces, and stir them into the cereal; set aside. Heat the remaining marshmallows and the butter in a large saucepan, over medium-high heat. Stir constantly, until there are no more lumps remaining, and then turn off the heat. Add the extracts and stir to combine. Pour the mixture over the cereal, and quickly mix until combined. Dump the mixture into the lined cake pan, and spread out evenly with a spatula. Sprinkle the chocolate chips over the top, and use your hands to lightly pat them down into the mixture. Refrigerate for 2 hours, and then cut into small squares.

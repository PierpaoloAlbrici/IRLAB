Instructions: 

1. Preheat oven to 350F and lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. 2. In a very large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves. 3. Make a well in the center and add in vegetable oil, pumpking puree, and beer. Stir just until no streaks of flour remain, and pour batter into prepared pan. 4. Bake for 55-60 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and the top springs back when lightly pressed. Loaf should be light or medium gold. 5. Allow to cool for 10 minutes. Turn out of the pan and allow the bread to cool on a wire rack before slicing.

### Ingredients

 - 4 cup of potatoes, raw, skin

 - 1 cup of celery, raw

 - 1 cup of onions, raw

 - 2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 cup of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

 - 14 cup of butter, without salt

 - 3 tablespoon of spices, parsley, dried

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

Put the potatoes, celery, onion, salt and water in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pan on top of stove. Cover pot and simmer for 20 minutes or until potatoes are tender (it's okay if they start to fall apart). Mash the mixture once or twice with a potato masher, but leave plenty of potato chunks. Stir in remaining ingredients and cook (do not boil) and stir until soup is heated completely. Serve hot.

Short Pastry Crust


Ingredients


 - 2 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of shortening, vegetable, household, composite


 - 1/4 to 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


Instructions: 

Pulse the flour, salt, butter, and shortening in a food processor until the mixture resembles coarse meal. With the processor running, drizzle in 1/4 cup water until the dough just comes together. (If the dough is still crumbly, add up to 1/4 cup more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time.) Do not process for more than 20 seconds. Divide the dough in half; wrap each in plastic. Refrigerate until cold, about 30 minutes.

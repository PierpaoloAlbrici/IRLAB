Banana Potatoes


Ingredients


 - 4 cup of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 3 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 6 teaspoon of butter, without salt


 - 12 teaspoon of bananas, raw


Instructions: 

Boil the water and butter together. Margarine can be used instead with no issues. Salt can be tossed in as well, but I don't use it. Remove the pot from heat. Mix in the milk and potato flakes. Stir until you get the desired consistancy. I usually stir for about 2-3 minutes when making this much. Add the banana extract. When its served fresh you won't taste the bananas much, but the cooler the potatoes get the more powerful the bananas will become.

Lacy Almond-Orange Cookies


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 3/4 teaspoon of spices, fennel seed


 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 3 tablespoon of honey


 - 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of orange juice, raw


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 375F, with racks in middle and lower thirds. In a food processor, pulse almonds and anise seeds until coarsely ground. Transfer mixture to a small saucepan. Add butter, sugar, honey, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring once to combine ingredients as butter melts. Boil 1 minute; remove from heat. Stir in flour and zest. Working quickly, drop batter by teaspoonfuls, 2 1/2 inches apart, onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake until golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes, rotating sheets halfway through. Let cool completely on sheets on wire racks. (Cookies can be stored between sheets of parchment in airtight containers up to 2 days at room temperature.)

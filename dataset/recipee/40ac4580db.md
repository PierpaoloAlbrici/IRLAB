[40ac4580db](http://www.food.com/recipe/nikis-chicken-wings-101610)

### Ingredients

 - 5 pound of chicken, broilers or fryers, wing, meat and skin, raw

 - 2 cup of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

 - 12 cup of lemon juice, raw

 - 1 tablespoon of spices, garlic powder

### Instructions

If using fresh chicken wings, clean. Seperate if you want. Niki cooks the complete wing as the tip is the"best part". Marinate in the soy, lemon juice and garlic powder for at least 24 hours. The longer the better! Bake in 350 degree oven for about an hour, turning half way through cooking time or grill. Probably great with a peanut sauce but they never seem to last that long at my house!

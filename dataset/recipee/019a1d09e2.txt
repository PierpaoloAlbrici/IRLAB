Honey Oat and Wheat Rolls


Ingredients


 - 1 1/4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of vinegar, cider


 - 2 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 3 tablespoon of honey


 - 3 tablespoon of sugars, granulated


 - 2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 2 2/3 cup of wheat flours, bread, unenriched


 - 23 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 23 cup of oats


 - 3 teaspoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry


Instructions: 

Note: You may decrease the amount of white flour and increase the wheat flour, but the bread will not rise as high. Add ingredients in the order suggested by the manufacturer. Set Cycle: Dough, Size: 2lb. Spray two baking sheets with non-stick cooking spray, and preheat the oven to 375F. When the cycle is finished, take the dough out and divide into 20 equal pieces (I use a scale). Roll into ropes about 8 inches long, and tie as you would a knot, press the ends together and place end-side down on the baking sheet. Allow to rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Brush with eggs or milk; eggs give a shiny, golden hard crust, milk gives a tender golden crust, water makes a light shine and crisp golden crust. Or brush with honey for a sweet crust after baking. Bake until well-browned, about 15 minutes.

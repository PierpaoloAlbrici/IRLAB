Chocolate-Dipped Salted Caramels Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1 1/2 cup of cream, fluid, heavy whipping


 - 1 1/3 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1/2 cup of syrups, corn, light


 - 1/2 cup of sugars, brown


 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract


 - 3 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 1/2 pound of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022


Instructions: 

Coat an 8-by-8-inch baking dish with butter. Cut a piece of parchment paperit should be a little less than 8 inches wide and long enough so that it rides over two sides of the dish when pressed into it. Press the parchment paper flat into the baking dish, creasing the paper at the corners. Coat the parchment-lined pan with more butter and place it on a wire rack. Place the cream in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, about 3 minutes. Stir in the sugar, corn syrup, and brown sugar and return to a boil, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until the sugars have dissolved, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and keep the mixture at a gently rolling boil, stirring occasionally, until it reaches 255 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 20 to 25 minutes. (It will reach 225 degrees F very quickly but then very slowly rise toward 255 degrees F.) Remove the pan from heat, add the butter, vanilla, and 2 1/2 teaspoons of the fleur de sel, and stir until the butter has melted and the mixture is combined. Pour into the prepared dish and let cool until the surface of the caramel is set and the dish is only slightly warm, about 1 hour. Place the dish in the freezer until the caramel is just firm, about 15 to 20 minutes (do not let it freeze for too long). Run a knife along the edges of the caramel. Using the exposed edges of parchment paper, pull the caramel slab from the pan, flip it over onto a work surface, and remove the parchment. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 teaspoon fleur de sel and press gently so that the salt adheres to the caramel. Cut into 3/4-inch squares. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Transfer all of the caramels to the baking sheet (making sure they dont touch) and place in the refrigerator to harden again. Bring a medium saucepan filled with 1 to 2 inches of water to a simmer over high heat; once simmering, turn off the heat. Place 18 ounces of the chocolate in a dry, heatproof bowl. Set the bowl over the saucepan and, using a rubber spatula, stir until the chocolate has completely melted and has reached 118 degrees F. (Make sure the chocolate does not come into contact with any water or exceed 120 degrees F.) Remove the bowl from the saucepan. Add the remaining 6 ounces chocolate and stir until all of the chocolate has melted and the temperature has cooled to 80 degrees F. (To speed this step up, you can place the bowl of chocolate over a bowl of ice waterbut only once all of the chocolate has melted.) Once cooled, return the bowl of chocolate to the saucepan and stir until the chocolate reaches 88 degrees F; immediately remove from heat. Do not remove the thermometer from the bowl; check the temperature periodically to make sure it stays between 87 degrees F and 89 degrees F. (The chocolate must remain in this temperature range while dipping the caramels or it will not set properly.) Keep the saucepan of water over low heat and, when needed, set the bowl of chocolate over it to reheat. To test if the chocolate is properly tempered, spread a thin layer on a piece of parchment paper and place it in the refrigerator for 3 minutes to set. If the chocolate hardens smooth and without streaks, it is properly tempered. (If it is not properly tempered, let the melted chocolate harden and start the tempering process over again: Bring the chocolate up to 118 degrees F, then down to 80 degrees F, then up again to 88 degrees F.) Line a second baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove the caramels from the refrigerator. Drop a caramel into the chocolate and, using a dinner fork, turn it to coat. Lift it out of the chocolate and tap the fork several times on the edge of the bowl. Scrape the bottom of the fork against the edge of the bowl to remove any excess chocolate. Place the coated caramel on the empty baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining caramels, using the first baking sheet when the second sheet is full and making sure the caramels do not touch. Let sit until the chocolate sets. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

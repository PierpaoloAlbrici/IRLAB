Truffle Mashed Potatoes


Ingredients


 - 3 pound of potatoes, raw, skin


 - 8 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard


 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1/2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 8 ounce of mushrooms, white, raw


 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder


 - 1/4 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


 - 1 tablespoon of chives, raw


Instructions: 

Peel potatoes and cut into chunks. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add the potatoes. Boil potatoes over high heat until a fork slides out easily when inserted (this will take 10-20 minutes depending on the size of the potato chunks). Drain and place in a mixing bowl. With an electric hand mixer, mix in cream cheese, butter and milk. Mix until whipped and well blended. Cover and place bowl in a warm place to keep warm. Slice and dice mushrooms into 1/4 inch pieces. Place vegetable oil in a small saute pan over medium heat. Once oil is heated add mushrooms and cook until browned (about 5 minutes). Add garlic powder to mushrooms and combine. Pour mushroom mixture over potatoes and mix well. Add truffle oil and mix it into the potatoes. Place in a serving dish, sprinkle with chives and drizzle extra truffle oil on top. Enjoy!

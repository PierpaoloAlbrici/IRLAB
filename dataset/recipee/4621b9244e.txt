Baked Peach Butter Recipe


Ingredients


 - 12 cup of peaches, yellow, raw


 - 4 cup of water, bottled, generic


 - 3 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 1/4 cup of honey


Instructions: 

To peel peaches easily, drop in boiling water for 30 seconds, then drop in ice water. Peels should pull off. Combine sliced peaches and water in an 8-qt enamel or possibly stainless steel pot and cook over medium heat for 20 to 25 min, or possibly till the peaches are soft. Stir frequently to prevent the peaches from sticking. When the fruit is tender, add in the honey or possibly sugar and lemon juice and stir to combine. Put the peach mix through a food mill or possibly puree in a blender or possibly food processor. Divide the puree between two shallow, 9- by 13-inch baking or possibly roasting pans. Bake, uncovered, for 1 hour at 325 degrees. Continue baking, stirring every 15 to 20 min, till the butter is thick. This will take an additional 1 to 1 1/2 hrs. The peach butter will be thick, fine-textured and a rich, reddish-amber in color. Wash jars and lids in warm, soapy water; sterilize jars in boiling-water bath for 10 min. Prepare lids according to manufacturer's directions. Ladle warm peach butter into warm jars, leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Cover with lids and process in a boiling-water bath for 5 min. This recipe yields 3 half-pint jars. Yield: 3 half-pints

### Ingredients

 - 350 g of orange juice, raw

 - 600 g of water, bottled, generic

 - 50 g of sugars, powdered

### Instructions

If you need to make the powdered sugar, do that first. Add the oranges and frozen almond milk to the sugar in the TM bowl. Slowly raise the speed to 10. Continue mixing for approximately 1 minute, or until all the ice is completely crushed. If the mixture is too soft or soupy, add ice cubes and re-blitz. The consistency will be like a thick smoothie. Pour into bowls and serve immediately.

Vickys Cherry Snowballs


Ingredients


 - 225 g of butter, without salt


 - 65 g of sugars, powdered


 - 225 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 115 g of nuts, pecans


 - 1 pinch of xanthan gum, upc: 071518021764


 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract


Instructions: 

Cream the margarine and icing sugar together until fluffy Beat in the rest of the ingredients apart from the cherries and caster sugar Mix well then take tablespoons of the dough and flatten out a little bit in your palm Put a cherry in each circle then pinch the dough up and around the cherry so it's encased Roll into balls and put onto a baking sheet Chill in the fridge on the baking sheet for 30 minutes Meanwhile preheat the oven to gas 3 / 160C / 325F Bake the cookies for 30 - 35 minutes Roll the balls in the sugar while they're warm. I recommend using icing sugar over superfine sugar Let cool on a wire rack then keep in an airtight container for up to 3 days *The ground nuts can be replaced with extra flour. Add a bit more vanilla though as the nuts impart good flavour

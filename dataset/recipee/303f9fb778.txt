Ingredients


 - 6 cup of blackberries, raw


 - 2 teaspoon of lemon juice, raw


 - 1 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 2 teaspoon of cornstarch


 - 1/4 cup of butter, without salt


 - 4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 1 tablespoon of salt, table


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 2 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 1 1/3 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


 - 1/4 cup of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place the blackberries in a mixing bowl, and sprinkle with lemon juice. Toss with 1 cup sugar and cornstarch until evenly coated. Place into the prepared baking dish, and arrange the cubes of butter on top. In a large bowl, whisk the flour, 1/4 cup sugar, cinnamon, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together. Cut in 1 cup of chilled, diced butter using a pastry cutter until the butter is in pieces no larger than a pea. Stir in the buttermilk until a batter has formed. Spoon the batter evenly over the blackberries. Brush the top of the batter with additional buttermilk to moisten, then sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until the the fruit is tender, and the biscuit top is golden, about 25 minutes.

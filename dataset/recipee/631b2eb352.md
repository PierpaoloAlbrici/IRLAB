### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of bacon, meatless

 - 2 cup of artichokes, (globe or french), raw

 - 1 cup of sugars, brown

### Instructions

Cut package of bacon slices in halves or possibly thirds crosswise to make shorter strips. Cut artichoke hearts in half. Wrap each piece of artichoke heart with a bacon strip and fasten with a toothpick. Spray a broiler pan (like the two-piece one which came with your stove) with Pam and arrage appetizers on it, not touching if possible. Up to this point recipe can be done ahead, wrapped in foil, and refrigerated if it has to wait more than 2 hrs. 15 min before serving time, sprinkle brown sugar over the top and bake in a 350 F. oven till bacon is crisped to your taste. Serve on a plate lined with paper napkins, or possibly if on a buffet put in warmer lined with paper towels or possibly a rack. of Linda Hurlbert Shogren NOTES : Make plenty of these, as they disappear like snowballs on a warm stove, but NOT if a meal is to follow as they are quite filling.

Raspberry Gelato


Ingredients


 - 2 cup of jams and preserves, apricot


 - 2 cup of milk, canned, condensed, sweetened


 - 3/4 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1/2 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d


 - 1/4 cup of nuts, walnuts, english


Instructions: 

Put all the ingredients (except walnuts) into a blender. Mix them up. Take a freezer safe bowl and drop the mixture into that. I like to keep it in the freezer for 24 hours before its served. But 4 hours is enough. I threw some chopped walnuts on that and it got delicious!

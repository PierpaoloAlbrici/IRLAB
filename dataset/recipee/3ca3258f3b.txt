Baked Apple Pudding


Ingredients


 - 125 g of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 100 g of butter, without salt


 - 100 g of honey


 - 150 g of apples, raw, with skin


Instructions: 

Grate the apple coarsely. Preheat the oven to 180C. In a bowl combine flour, baking powder, honey and cinnamon. In a second bowl cream the butter. Add the butter to the flour mixture and blend well. Stir in the grated apple and fill the dough into 2 oven-proof dishes. Bake for about 40 minutes (you might have to cover the puddings after 20 minutes if they get too brown on top). Serve with whipped cream, vanilla ice-cream or vanilla sauce.

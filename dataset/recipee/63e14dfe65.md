### Ingredients

 - 240 g of shortening confectionery, coconut (hydrogenated) and or palm kernel (hydrogenated)

 - 200 g of dates, deglet noor

 - 1 tablespoon of cocoa, dry powder, unsweetened

### Instructions

1. Put two thirds of the coconut and the dates into a food processor or blender. 2. Blitz on high for 2 minutes, then scrape down the sides of the food processor. 3. Add the cocoa powder and blitz for another 1-2 minutes and again scrape down the side of the food processor so that all the mixture is perfectly combined. 4. Remove from the food processor and roll into little balls (roughly the size of a teaspoon). 5. Roll the balls in the rest of the desiccated coconut. You could use chopped nuts for this bit if you prefer. 6. Store in the fridge in an airtight container for whenever you need a healthy snack.

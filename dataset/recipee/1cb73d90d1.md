### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 18 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 teaspoon of orange juice, raw

 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate

 - 12 cup of margarine, regular, 80% fat, composite, stick, without salt

 - 3 ounce of cheese, parmesan, hard

 - 1 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 12 cup of jams and preserves, apricot

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Sift the dry ingredients together (I used a dried orange peel, so it was sifted with my other dry ingredients). Using a pastry blender, cut the margarine and cream cheese into the dry ingredients (like a pie crust). Sprinkle the milk onto this mixture, mix and gather into a ball. On a lightly a floured surface, roll to 1/8" thickness. Use a 2" or 3" cutter to make 16-18 rounds. Spoon 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons jelly onto the center of each round (don't use too much or it will "bleed out" when baking). Fold the cookie over and bake on an ungreased cookie sheet for 12-14 minutes (oven time may be less-- I used a toaster oven).

Tahini


Ingredients


 - 5 cup of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried


 - 1 cup of oil, olive, salad or cooking


Instructions: 

Heat your oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the sesame seeds on a sheet tray, and roast them for 10 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally. You do not want them to brown, you just want them to develop that lovely nutty smell. Set tray aside and allow seeds to cool for 30 minutes. Pour your seeds into a blender and add 1 cup of the oil to get it going. Once it is mixing, add the remaining 1/2 cup of oil, or more if you like. The mixture should pour easily. Blend until it is smooth, a couple minutes. Pour into a jar or tight-lidded container and store in your fridge for up to 3 months. Makes 4 cups. Note: I tried using my food processor to puree the seeds, and even after 5 minutes, the mix still wasnt smooth. The blender is the way to go for this recipe, in my opinion.

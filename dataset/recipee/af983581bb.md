### Ingredients

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1/4 cup of cornstarch

 - 3 pound of chicken, broilers or fryers, wing, meat and skin, raw

 - 1 cup of sauce, barbecue

 - 4 1/2 teaspoon of soy sauce made from soy (tamari)

 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

 - 1/4 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray baking sheet with cooking spray and set aside. Mix together black pepper, salt, and cornstarch. Dry chicken with paper towels and place pieces in a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle spice mixture over chicken and toss with a plastic spatula to coat evenly. Place wings on a baking sheet, spray lightly with cooking spray, and bake about 20 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. While wings are baking, whisk together all sauce ingredients and heat on stove top or in the microwave just until warmed. Put sauce in a large bowl. When chicken is done baking, add to sauce bowl and toss to coat wings evenly. Serve immediately. Note: if you dont have honey BBQ sauce on hand, you can use regular BBQ sauce and add 1-2 tablespoons of honey, to taste! (Recipe adapted from Kraft and Cooks Illustrated.)

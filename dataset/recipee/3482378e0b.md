### Ingredients

 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 tablespoon of honey

 - 13 cup of sugars, brown

 - 1 1/4 cup of oats

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of spices, ginger, ground

 - 18 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 180c. Line an 8-inch, shallow, round cake tin with baking paper. Place butter, syrup, and sugar in a pan over low heat. Cook, stirring, until melted and combined. Remove from heat and add oats and salt. Mix together. Place mix into pan, press firmly and smooth the surface. Bake until golden brown for approximately 20-25 minutes. Leave in the pan until cool enough to handle, then turn out and cut into wedges while still hot. The wedges become quite hard when cooled.

Vegan Peanut Butter Cookies


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 34 cup of oats


 - 1 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 cup of peanut butter, smooth style, without salt


 - 18 cup of soymilk, original and vanilla, unfortified


 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 375F Lightly grease a cookie sheet. Combine flour, salt and baking powder in a large mixing bowl. Set aside. In a small microwaveable bowl, heat peanut butter in microwave for about 45 seconds or until soft. Stir in sugar and soy milk, adding enough soy milk to have a pretty milky consistency. Pour the peanut butter mixture immediately into the mixing bowl containing the dry ingredients. Mix until slightly moist. Add rolled oats. Continue mixing until well combined, you may have to add more soy milk as this batter will be thick. Drop by spoonfuls onto cookie sheet and press fork marking onto the middle. Bake for about 10 minutes.

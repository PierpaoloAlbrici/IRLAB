Tiger Swirl Fudge

 - 4 ounce of pascha, organic bitter-sweet dark chocolate chips, upc: 842638005022


Instructions: 

Line a 17-by 11-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. In a bowl set over a saucepan of steaming, not boiling, water, melt white chocolate. Add peanut butter, stirring until blended and creamy. Pour onto prepared baking sheet. Smooth with offset spatula to edges of baking sheet. In same bowl, set over lightly simmering water, melt bittersweet chocolate. Drizzle over white chocolate. Using the tip of a knife, swirl chocolates to create a marble effect. Refrigerate (this is an exception to the refrigeration rule) until firm, for 30 minutes. Break into pieces. Wrap carefully in plastic wrap and place in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

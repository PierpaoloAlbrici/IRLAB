Flaky, Fluffy Southern Buttermilk Biscuits


Ingredients


 - 6 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 1 tablespoon of leavening agents, baking powder, double-acting, sodium aluminum sulfate


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1/4 teaspoon of leavening agents, baking soda


 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat


Instructions: 

Heat oven to 450 F. Generously grease the bottom of a large baking sheet with butter. Use a box grater to grate the cold butter into a small bowl. Or, cut butter with a knife into very small cubes. Place bowl in freezer. In a large bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda until well combined. Add grated butter and, using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in butter until its the size of small peas. Pour in the cold buttermilk and stir mixture with a wooden spoon just until a dough forms (do not over-mix). Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface; very gently pat into a rough ball. Use a sharp knife or bench scraper to cut dough in half. Place one half on top of the other half, and very gently press halves together, shaping into a rough ball again. Repeat this process 3 times. Gently shape dough into a rough rectangle about 1-inch thick. Cut dough into 12 equal squares; transfer to prepared baking sheet, spacing biscuits at least 1 inch apart. Place baking sheet in freezer 10 minutes to re-chill dough. Transfer baking sheet directly from freezer to oven and bake biscuits 10 to 12 minutes until golden and fluffy. Serve immediately.

### Ingredients

 - 1 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

 - 1 teaspoon of honey

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2-4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 2 tablespoon of vital wheat gluten

 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of leavening agents, yeast, baker's, active dry

 - 1 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

### Instructions

Mix water, oil, honey and yeast. Add wheat gluton, garlic powder (optional) and two cups of the flour. If you are using a mixer like a Bosch, Dimension or a KitchenAid you add additional flour until the sides of the mixer come clean. Knead about 7 minutes in your mixer. If mixing by hand add one cup at a time until the right consistence and knead until smooth and elastic. If you choose you can let the dough rise but I just divide the dough and half and roll out one on my pizza stone. After you roll the dough out pierce the rolled out pizza dough with a fork. Bake the pizza crust 450 degrees for about five minutes. Add your toppings such as sauce and cheese or whatever you want on pizza and then put back into the oven at 450 for about 10 minutes. Repeat for the second crust.

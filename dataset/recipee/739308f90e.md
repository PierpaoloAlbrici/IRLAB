### Ingredients

 - 8 cup of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 cup of milk, buttermilk, fluid, cultured, lowfat

 - 2-3 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 12-34 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

### Instructions

In a large pot or very deep sauce pan, bring the milk (but not the buttermilk) up to the temperature of 175 F while occasionally stirring. Do this slowly on a low to medium heat to prevent burning. Once the milk has reached 175 F, turn off the heat and immediately stir in the buttermilk and lemon juice. You will notice the curds forming almost immediately. Allow approximately 10 to 15 minutes for all the curds to form. When the curds finish forming, scoop them into a colander lined with a double layer of cheese cloth. Create a pouch and hang the cheese so it can continue to strain. Hang the homemade cheese for 1 24 hours depending on the desired texture (it will be ready to eat in about an hour). After the cheese is done hanging, unwrap it, place it in a bowl, and mix in salt and pepper. This would also be the time to add other flavors such as herbs, garlic, or spices.

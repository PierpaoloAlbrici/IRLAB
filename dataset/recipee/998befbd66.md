### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

 - 50-60 ml of water, bottled, generic

 - 2 teaspoon of oil, canola

### Instructions

Mix the flour, salt and oil together. Add a little water as you knead your way to a good dough ball. Once the dough comes together, it should not be too wet or lumpy. Divide the dough into 2. Roll the dough into a ball, flatten it, then dip into extra flour. Roll it into a thin circle. Wrap the dough with cling wrap and put in a dry warm place for 30 minutes. Heat up a pan, toss roti from one hand to another to remove excess flour, then dry fry it. Using a spatula, beat the roti during cookingso as to make it puff up slightly.

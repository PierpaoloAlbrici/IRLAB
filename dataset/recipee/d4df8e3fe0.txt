Spiced Nuts


Ingredients


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cumin seed


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne


 - 1/2 teaspoon of spices, cinnamon, ground


 - 4 cup of nuts, almonds


 - 4 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 6 tablespoon of sugars, brown


 - 1 tablespoon of water, bottled, generic


 - 1 teaspoon of salt, table


Instructions: 

Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper and set aside. In a small bowl, mix the spices and set aside. In a large dry skillet, place the nuts and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until they begin to toast, about 4 minutes. Add the butter and cook, stirring, until the nuts begin to darken, about 1 minute. Add the spices, the sugar, water, and the salt and cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens and the nuts are glazed, about 5 minutes. Transfer the nuts to the prepared baking sheet, separating them with a fork. Let the nuts stand until cooled and the sugar has hardened, about 10 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

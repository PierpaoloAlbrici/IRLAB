Instructions: 

For Cake:. Preheat oven to 350. Stir first 5 ingredients directly into an ungreased 9X13 cake pan. In a bowl, stir together water, vinegar, and vanilla; pour over dry ingredients. Pour oil over all. Using a fork, stir until mixture is a uniform color and has no lumps. Bake 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool COMPLETELY in pan then frost with icing #1 and drizzle icing #2 over that. Icing #1. Whisk together flour and milk in a small saucepan over medium-high heat; cook, whisking constantly, until mixture has thickened. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Beat butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add flour mixture and beat until icing is fluffy and sugar is dissolved. Icing #2. Needs to be scaled way down because if you use it all it makes a big soupy mess on top of the cake so I always throw MOST of this away! Combine first 5 ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat until butter melts, stirring well. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil; cook 1 minute, without stirring. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Beat until thick. I always use one of those squirt bottles you can get anywhere for this step; pour into squirt bottle and drizzle as much as you want on top of cake over icing #1.

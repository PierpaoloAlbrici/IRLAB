### Ingredients

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 1/2 cup of onions, raw

 - 14 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 1/2 cup of cream, sour, cultured

 - 34 cup of salad dressing, mayonnaise, regular

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, garlic powder

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, black

 - 14 teaspoon of spices, pepper, red or cayenne

 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

In a saute pan over medium heat add oil, heat and add onions and salt. Cook the onions until they are caramelized, about 20 minutes. Note: it is very important to cook the onions long enough, until they are nice and golden. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. Mix the rest of the ingredients, and then add the cooled onions. Refrigerate and stir again before serving. Taste, and add additional seasonings, if desired.

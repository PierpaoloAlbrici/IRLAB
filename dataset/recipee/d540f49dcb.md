Combine all ingredients in a bowl. Dough should form a ball, if this does not happen, add a little more water incrementally until it does. Then cover the dough with a wet towel or cloth for 15 minutes. Split the dough into 2 pieces and roll into balls. Lightly flour your work surface and roll each ball into a very flat circle. Cook in an ungreased skillet over medium heat until the tortilla starts to show brown spots. Fill with whatever you want and enjoy!

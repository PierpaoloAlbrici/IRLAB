### Ingredients

 - 15 ounce of pumpkin, raw

 - 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

 - 1 teaspoon of pumpkin, raw

 - 1/4 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 2 cup of oats

 - 1/2 cup of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 1/2 cup of nuts, walnuts, english

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 F. Line 2 cookie sheets with Silpat mats or parchment paper. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl, stir together pumpkin puree, vanilla, pumpkin pie spice and sea salt until well blended. Mix in the oats, chocolate chips and walnuts until well combined. Drop heaping tablespoons of batter onto cookie sheets spacing them an inch or so apart. You may want to flatten the cookies slightly with a lightly oiled palm or the bottom of a glass since they do not spread in the oven. Bake cookies in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. When done, they should be slightly brown on the bottoms. Remove pans from oven and set them on a rack. Cool cookies for 5 minutes on the baking sheet then transfer to wire racks to cool for an additional 20 minutes. Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days.

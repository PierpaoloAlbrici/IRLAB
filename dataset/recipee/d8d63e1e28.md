[d8d63e1e28](http://www.food.com/recipe/sesame-crusted-jam-thumbprints-small-batch-464619)

### Ingredients

 - 12 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 1/2 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

 - 1 tablespoon of butter, without salt

 - 1 tablespoon of jams and preserves, apricot

 - 12 tablespoon of seeds, sesame seeds, whole, dried

### Instructions

In a bowl combine flour, sugar, salt and butter. Knead into a smooth dough. If it is too crumbly, add a little milk or water (just enough to make it workable). If it is too wet, add enough flour to make dough workable. Put the sesame seeds onto a plate or platter. Take off walnut-sized dough nuggets and roll them into balls. Flatten them slightly pressing them into the sesame seeds. Transfer cookies to a paper-lined baking sheet and make an indentation in the middle of each cookie using your fingers or the handle of a spoon. Fill this with jam/nutella/nut butter. Bake in the preheated oven at 190C/375F for 12-15 minutes or until bottoms are slightly golden. Allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

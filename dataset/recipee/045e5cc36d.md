### Ingredients

 - 1 pound of strawberries, raw

 - 2/3 to 1.5 cup of sugars, brown

 - 2 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

### Instructions

Wash and stem/hull the strawberries. (I prefer to use the smaller ones) Combine the strawberries, lemon juice and sugar in a thick bottomed pot. Cover and boil it over medium to med low heat for 12 to 15 minutes. Open and mash the strawberries with a potato masher or a wooden spoon in the pot. Lower the heat to low and let it sizzle for 30 minutes until it bubbly and turns shiny jelly but still runny. Stir and mash the strawberries from time to time to keep the jam from burning. Remove from the heat and let cool. Put it into a STERILE small glass jar. Serve when desired

### Ingredients

 - 8 teaspoon of butter, without salt

 - 3 cup of cheese, parmesan, hard

### Instructions

Invert one 1+1/4 c custard cup. Cover with paper towel. Melt 1 tsp butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium low heat. Sprinkle a generous 1/3 cup of cheese, forming a 6-inch round. Cook until cheese melts and bottom is golden, pressing with a spatula to flatten, about 4 minutes. Turn cheese over. Cook until second side is golden, about 3 minutes. Place cheese round on top of towel covered custard cup. Top with two folded paper towels and press down on cheese to form cup shape, about 30 seconds. Remove paper towels. Turn cheese baskets right side up to cool. Repeat with remaining butter and cheese, using clean towels for each basket. Can be made six hours in advance and stored airtight at room temperature.

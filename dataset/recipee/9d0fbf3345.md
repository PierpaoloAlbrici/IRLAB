 - 2 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 2 tablespoon of oil, olive, salad or cooking

 - 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, raw

 - 3 tablespoon of honey

 - 1 1/2 teaspoon of salt, table

### Instructions

Add the ingredients in the order listed and sprinkle the ground flax over top. I use the whole wheat, 2 lb, and light crust settings and make the bread overnight so it's fresh first thing in the morning. I have also added a 1/4 cup of sunflower seeds sprinkled over top of the flaxseed.

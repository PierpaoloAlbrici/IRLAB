### Ingredients

 - 13 cup of soup, swanson chicken broth 99% fat free

 - 13 cup of onions, spring or scallions (includes tops and bulb), raw

 - 1 pinch of spices, pepper, black

 - 13 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt

### Instructions

Bring the stock to a boil with the green onion and pepper. Add the rice; turn down to a simmer and cover; cook for 20 minutes. NOTE: If you want drier rice, remove the cover at 20 minutes and heat just a minute or so longer. VARIATIONS: Rice made with fish stock can be served with fish, beef-stock rich with beef. If you begin adding more vegetables, you will end up with a jambalaya instead of a side course of Country Rice.

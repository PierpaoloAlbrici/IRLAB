Ground Turkey, Edamame & Brown Rice One-Skillet Wonder Recipe windycityprince


Ingredients


 - 1 pound of ground turkey, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of onions, raw


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, basil, dried


 - 1 tablespoon of spices, oregano, dried


 - 32 ounce of soup, vegetable broth, ready to serve


 - 16 ounce of edamame, frozen, prepared


 - 1 1/2 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 10 3/4 ounce of soup, cream of chicken, canned, condensed


Instructions: 

In a large skillet, begin to brown the ground turkey on medium-high. Pour in the broth and, using a cooking spoon or spatula, start to break up the meat. Add in the onion, basil and oregano. Stir regularly until the skillet starts to boil. Then add in the edamame and brown rice. Stir until well mixed, making sure there is still enough broth to cover the ingredients. If necessary, turn down the heat to allow for the dish to simmer on the stoves burner. Typically, it should take about 15 minutes or so for the rice and edamame to properly cook and absorb the broth. Stir regularly to ensure even cooking. Watch the level of broth in the skillet. As soon as it almost disappears, remove the skillet from the burner and stir in the cream of mushroom soup until well blended.

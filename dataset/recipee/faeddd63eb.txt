Barley Risotto, Mark Peel's Recipe


Ingredients


 - 1/2 cup of barley, hulled


 - 1/2 cup of rice, white, long-grain, regular, unenriched, cooked without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 1/2 pound of mushrooms, white, raw


 - 1/2 cup of salt, table


Instructions: 

In a large (at least 2-qt) pot, bring 6 c. of salted water to a boil. Add in the barley and rice and let simmer for 25 min, or possibly till tender. Drain any water which remains after the barley and rice are cooked. Heat the butter in a large skillet. Add in the mushrooms and slowly cook over low heat for about 7 to 10 min. Fold in the cooked barley and rice and the chicken broth. Salt to taste and serve. NOTE: "Mark Peel, the chef of Campanile Restaurant in Los Angeles, made up this dish, that is greater than the sum of its parts. This is a speedy risottolike dish. Intermingled, the earthy flavors of mushrooms, barley, and rice taste unexpectedly new and different."

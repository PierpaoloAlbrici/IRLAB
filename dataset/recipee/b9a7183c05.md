### Ingredients

 - 1 1/3 cup of lime juice, raw

 - 1 quart of water, bottled, generic

 - 12 cup of sugars, granulated

### Instructions

In large pitcher, mix together the lime juice, water, and smaller amount of sugar. Taste and add more sugar if you think the limonada needs it. Serve over ice. To make the Tropical Pink Limeade: cut the ends off 2 or 3 prickly pears;( handle prickly pears with latex or rubber gloves or with tongs, prickly pears are a cactus fruit and have stickers all over outer skin). Make a shallow slit down the length of each one, then peel away the thick skin; discard skin. In a small bowl, crush the fruit into a coarse puree, then strain puree into the limeade mixture. Taste and add more lime or sugar if necessary.

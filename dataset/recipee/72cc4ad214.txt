Raspberry Jam


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of raspberries, raw


 - 3/4 cup of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. 2. Put the raspberries and sugar into two separate shallow bowls. Note: I use large glass measuring cups, so the fruit will be spread out rather than pile up, and the liquid is easier to pour. 3. Put the bowls/cups into the oven for 20-25 minutes until they are really hot. 4. Take them out of the oven carefully, and add the sugar to the raspberries. 5. Stir the mixture until the fruit turns into liquid. 6. Pour this into a cleaned and waiting 8-ounce jar. 7. Allow to cool slightly. 8. Screw the lid on the jar, and leave to cool before storing in the refrigerator. Note: Quick and simple...and delicious. Goes well with hot biscuits.

### Ingredients

 - 1 cup of butter, without salt

 - 13 cup of sugars, granulated

 - 23 cup of nuts, almonds

 - 1 23 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 18 teaspoon of salt, table

 - 1 cup of sugars, powdered

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cream together the butter and sugar. Add the almonds. Combine the flour and salt and stir into the butter mixture. Pinch off about 1 tablespoon of dough. Roll it between your palms to make a cigar shape. Place on a parchment-lined cookie sheet and gently curve it into a cresent. Repeat, placing the cookies 2 inches apart. Bake until the edges are barely golden, about 12 minutes. Immediately transfer cookies to a rack to cool. Cookies can be frozen in an airtight container, with wax paper between each layer, for up to 6 months. Defrost 30 minutes before serving. Immediately before serving, dust with powdered sugar.

### Ingredients

 - 1 1/2 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 1 dash of salt, table

 - 1/2 cup of shortening, vegetable, household, composite

 - 1/2 cup of water, bottled, generic

### Instructions

Place the flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Add the shortening and cut it in with a pastry blender, or use your hands, as I do. Add the water, a tablespoon at a time, kneading until the dough is smooth. Roll out the dough to fit a 9-inch pie pan.

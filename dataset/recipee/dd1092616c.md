### Ingredients

 - 3 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched

 - 3 tablespoon of milk, fluid, 1% fat, without added vitamin a and vitamin d

 - 1 pinch of salt, table

### Instructions

Combine all of the ingredients until smooth. Heat oil in a frying pan and pour in the batter. Don't spread the batter too thinly. Once both sides have nicely browned, it's done. Top with your choice of sweet toppings and enjoy hot. I love eating these topped with red bean paste.

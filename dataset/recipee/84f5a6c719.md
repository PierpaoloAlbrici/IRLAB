### Ingredients

 - 157 ml of cream, whipped, cream topping, pressurized

 - 1 tablespoon of sugars, granulated

 - 225 g of spartan, real semi-sweet chocolate baking chips, upc: 011213162966

 - 57 g of butter, without salt

### Instructions

Prepare a 7x7 dish by lining it with greaseproof paper for easy removal of the torte once cold. Measure out the butter and chocolate and chop up ready for adding later. Put the cream, sugar and salt in a pan and bring slowly to near boiling stirring constantly. You should see small bubbles at the edges of the pan. Add the butter and chocolate and stir well until melted. Then add any other flavourings if desired (eg ginger etc) (optional). Pour into prepared dish and chill in fridge overnight or until set (at least 7 hours I'd guess). When set torte can be turned carefully onto serving dish where it will sit firm and not ooze. You can then decorate with cream / fruit / drizzled white chocolate (optional).

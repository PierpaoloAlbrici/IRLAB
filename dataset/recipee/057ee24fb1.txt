Shortbread


Ingredients


 - 1 cup of butter, without salt


 - 2 tablespoon of butter, without salt


 - 12 teaspoon of salt, table


 - 1 3/4 cup of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 2 tablespoon of wheat flour, white, all-purpose, unenriched


 - 12 cup of cornstarch


 - 2 tablespoon of cornstarch


 - 13 cup of sugars, granulated


 - 14 cup of sugars, granulated


Instructions: 

Preheat oven to 325; butter a 10x6 inch glass baking dish. Add butter to a mixing bowlthe butter must be very soft, the consistency of mayonnaise or whipped cream. Add the salt to the butter and mix well with a wooden spoon or whisk sot that it dissolves completely before you add the rest of the ingredients. Sift the flour and cornstarch together into a bowl. Add the sugar to the butter and mix just until combined. Add the flour mixture and mix just until a smooth dough forms. Pat the dough evenly into the prepared baking dish; the dough should be no more than 2/3 inch deep. Bake until the top and bottom are lightly browned, about 30 minutes. The middle of the shortbread should remain light; let cool on a wire rack until warm to touch. Sprinkle the shortbread with the superfine sugar; tilt the dish so that the sugar fully and evenly coats the surface and then tip out the excess sugar. With a very thin, sharp knife, cut the shortbread into rectangular fingers, about 1/2 inch wide and 2 inches long; if the cookies have become cold, they will not slice well, so they must still be warm to the touch at this point. Chill thoroughly before removing from the baking dish; the first cookie is difficult to remove, but the rest should come out easily with the aid of a small, thin offset spatula.
